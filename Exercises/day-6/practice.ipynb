        "# ETL Pipeline Lab Exercise: Heart Disease UCI Dataset in Google Colab\n",
        "\n",
        "## Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, you will build a complete ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipeline in Google Colab that processes the \"Heart Disease UCI\" dataset from Kaggle.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Your Tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Extract:**\n",
        "   - Download the dataset file `heart.csv` using the Kaggle API in your Colab notebook.\n",
        "   - Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Transform:**\n",
        "   - Clean and preprocess the data by handling any missing values and renaming columns for better readability if needed.\n",
        "   - Create a new column named `RiskLevel` which categorizes patients into:\n",
        "     - \"Low\"\n",
        "     - \"Medium\"\n",
        "     - \"High\"\n",
        "     \n",
        "     based on their `age` and `cholesterol` levels.\n",
        "   - Normalize key numerical features to prepare the dataset for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Load:**\n",
        "   - Store the transformed DataFrame into a local SQLite database inside Google Colab.\n",
        "   - Write and execute SQL queries on the stored data to:\n",
        "     - Retrieve counts of patients grouped by `RiskLevel`.\n",
        "     - Filter and display records of patients classified as `High` risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Constraints\n",
        "\n",
        "- Perform all operations using **pandas**, **SQLite**, and the **Kaggle API** entirely within Google Colab.\n",
        "- Do **not** use any external cloud databases or services.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dataset Details\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dataset name:** Heart Disease UCI  \n",
        "- **Kaggle URL:** [https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Expected Learning Outcomes\n",
        "\n",
        "- Gain hands-on experience in extracting data from Kaggle using the API in Colab.\n",
        "- Practice data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization using pandas.\n",
        "- Store and query data efficiently in a local SQLite database within Colab.\n",
        "- Build reproducible ETL workflows using only free and local resources.\n",
        "\n",
