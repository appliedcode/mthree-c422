The primary driver of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), which are largely emitted through the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.\n","\n","### Causes of Climate Change\n","\n","1. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: The combustion of fossil fuels for energy and transportation is the largest source of GHG emissions. This includes coal, oil, and natural gas, which release CO2 when burned.\n","\n","2. **Deforestation**: Trees absorb CO2, so when forests are cleared for agriculture or urban development, the carbon stored in trees is released back into the atmosphere.\n","\n","3. **Industrial Processes**: Many industrial activities release various GHGs, including methane from landfills and nitrous oxide from agricultural practices.\n","\n","4. **Agricultural Practices**: Agriculture contributes to climate change through methane emissions from livestock and rice cultivation, and nitrous oxide from fertilized soils.\n","\n","### Effects of Climate Change\n","\n","1. **Rising Temperatures**: Average global temperatures have increased, leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves.\n","\n","2. **Melting Ice Caps and Glaciers**: The Arctic and Antarctic regions are experiencing rapid ice melting, contributing to rising sea levels.\n","\n","3. **Sea Level Rise**: Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities and ecosystems, leading to increased flooding and erosion.\n","\n","4. **Extreme Weather Events**: There is an increase in the frequency and severity of hurricanes, droughts, floods, and wildfires.\n","\n","5. **Biodiversity Loss**: Changing climates disrupt ecosystems, leading to habitat loss and threatening various species with extinction.\n","\n","6. **Ocean Acidification**: Increased CO2 levels lead to higher concentrations of carbonic acid in oceans, affecting marine life, particularly coral reefs and shellfish.\n","\n","### Mitigation and Adaptation\n","\n","To address climate change, two primary strategies are employed: mitigation and adaptation.\n","\n","- **Mitigation** involves reducing or preventing the emission of GHGs. This can be achieved through renewable energy sources (like solar and wind), energy efficiency, reforestation, and carbon capture technologies.\n","\n","- **Adaptation** involves making adjustments in social, economic, and environmental practices to minimize the damage caused by climate changes. This includes building resilient infrastructures, developing sustainable agricultural practices, and creating effective water management\n","\n","Clear Output:\n"," Climate change happens mainly because of human activities, like burning fossil fuels for energy and cutting down forests. These actions release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which trap heat and warm the planet. But the good news is that we can make a difference by using clean energy, planting trees, and making smarter choices in our daily lives!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Principle 2 ‚Äî Specify Format**\n","\n","**Goal:** Tell the AI exactly how to structure its response."],"metadata":{"id":"5iqa31WSqcBA"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["prompt = \"\"\"\n","List 3 benefits of learning Python.\n","Format the output as a markdown table with columns: 'Benefit' and 'Description'.\n","\"\"\"\n","print(ask_gpt(prompt))"],"metadata":{"id":"DWtx2g3jqd1-","outputId":"53c3c3dc-115a-4056-ce09-4befa3832f2d","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754917721312,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":24810,"user":{"displayName":"Rania","userId":"13750069140470329881"}}},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Here's a markdown table listing three benefits of learning Python along with their descriptions:\n","\n","```markdown\n","| Benefit                    | Description                                                                                     |\n","|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n","| Easy to Learn             | Python has a simple and readable syntax, making it accessible for beginners and reducing the learning curve. |\n","| Versatile and Flexible     | Python can be used in various fields such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation, making it a versatile programming language. |\n","| Strong Community Support   | Python has a large and active community, providing extensive resources, libraries, and frameworks, as well as support for learners and developers. |\n","```\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**üéØ Student Exercise:**\n","\n","- Ask GPT to **compare electric cars and petrol cars** with format instructions:\n","    - First: Paragraph form\n","    - Second: Markdown table form\n","- Compare clarity and usefulness."],"metadata":{"id":"edBRTfupqhub"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["para_prompt = \"Compare electric cars and petrol cars.\"\n","table_prompt = \"Compare electric cars and petrol cars as a markdown table with rows for cost, performance, and environmental impact.\"\n","\n","print(\"Paragraph Output:\\n\", ask_gpt(para_prompt))\n","print(\"\\nTable Output:\\n\", ask_gpt(table_prompt))"],"metadata":{"id":"Pg1mp1Wgql5v","outputId":"e5688bf6-8011-4bcd-de66-a7177784db74","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754917762846,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":35897,"user":{"displayName":"Rania","userId":"13750069140470329881"}}},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Paragraph Output:\n"," Certainly! Electric cars (EVs) and petrol (gasoline) cars each have their own advantages and disadvantages.
