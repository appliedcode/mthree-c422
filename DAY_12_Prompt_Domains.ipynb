            "1. **Function Definition**: The `binary_search` function takes an array `arr` and a `target` value to search for.\n",
            "2. **Input Check**: If the array is empty, it returns -1.\n",
            "3. **Order Determination**: It checks if the array is sorted in ascending or descending order based on the first and last elements.\n",
            "4. **Binary Search Logic**: The function uses a standard binary search approach:\n",
            "   - It calculates the middle index and compares the middle element with the target.\n",
            "   - Depending on the order of the array (ascending or descending), it adjusts the search range accordingly.\n",
            "5. **Unit Tests**: The `test_binary_search` function runs various assertions to ensure the `binary_search` function behaves as expected for both ascending and descending sorted arrays, including edge cases like empty arrays.\n",
            "\n",
            "When you run the tests, they should all pass, confirming that the binary search implementation is working correctly.\n"
