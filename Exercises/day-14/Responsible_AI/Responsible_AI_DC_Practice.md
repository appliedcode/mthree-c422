## **Problem Statement: Responsible AI for Healthcare Diagnostics**

You are part of a **hospital’s AI innovation team** developing a **machine learning–based diagnostic tool** to help identify patients at risk for chronic diseases.
The system analyzes patient demographic and clinical data, including blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and family medical history, and classifies patients into risk categories: *Low*, *Medium*, or *High*.

Your role is to:

- Evaluate how **ethical principles** (fairness, privacy, transparency, accountability) can be embedded at every stage of this AI system’s lifecycle — from data collection and model design to deployment and monitoring.
- Identify potential **biases** in predictions (e.g., differences in performance across gender or age groups) and their possible consequences for patient safety.
- Assess **stakeholder trust** in AI healthcare tools and propose strategies to enhance adoption through explainability, human oversight, and transparent communication.
- Recommend an **action plan** for deploying the model responsibly, meeting both clinical and ethical standards.

### **Dataset Loading Code (Colab-Ready)**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(2025)
n = 300

# Synthetic patient dataset for AI‐based risk prediction
genders = ["Male", "Female"]
age_groups = ["18-30", "31-45", "46-60", "60+"]
trust_levels = ["High", "Medium", "Low"]

data_health = pd.DataFrame({
    "Patient_ID": range(1, n+1),
    "Gender": np.random.choice(genders, n, p=[0.48, 0.52]),
    "Age_Group": np.random.choice(age_groups, n),
    "Blood_Pressure": np.random.randint(90, 180, n),
    "Cholesterol_Level": np.random.randint(150, 300, n),
    "Family_History_Risk": np.random.choice([0, 1], n, p=[0.6, 0.4]),
    "AI_Diagnosis": np.random.choice(
        ["Low Risk", "Medium Risk", "High Risk"],
        n, p=[0.5, 0.3, 0.2]
    ),
    "Public_Trust_in_AI": np.random.choice(trust_levels, n, p=[0.35, 0.45, 0.2])
})

print("Sample healthcare dataset:\n")
print(data_health.head())
```
