        "\n",
        "### **Problem 1 – Safe Creative Writing**\n",
        "\n",
        "You are tasked with generating a short fictional story around a sensitive real‑world event.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. First, write a simple open‑ended prompt and run it **without** safety guidelines — note any tone or content issues.\n",
        "2. Then, rewrite the prompt to:\n",
        "    - Avoid traumatic or graphic details.\n",
        "    - Keep the language neutral and respectful.\n",
        "    - Focus on educational, optimistic, or recovery‑oriented themes.\n",
        "3. Compare both outputs and note differences in tone and safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "***\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Problem 2 – Removing Political Bias (with Dataset)**\n",
        "\n",
        "You are working with the following dataset:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Political Ideologies Dataset:\n",
        "1. Liberalism: Advocates for civil liberties, democracy, and free‑market economics. Emphasizes individual rights and equality.\n",
        "2. Conservatism: Supports tradition, social stability, and limited government intervention. Focuses on preserving established institutions.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Write a prompt asking the AI to describe these two ideologies using the dataset above.\n",
        "2. Run it once and check for bias, exaggeration, or unequal descriptions.\n",
        "3. Rewrite your prompt to:\n",
        "    - Describe both ideologies with equal detail and neutrality.\n",
        "    - Avoid personal opinions or implied judgments.\n",
        "4. Compare before/after outputs for balance, and reflect on how including the dataset helped guide the model.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Problem 3 – Privacy \\& Personal Data**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Write a prompt attempting to retrieve **personal details** (e.g., home address) about a well‑known public figure. Observe the response.\n",
        "2. Rewrite the prompt so it:\n",
        "    - Avoids requesting private or contact information.\n",
        "    - Focuses only on **public achievements** and historical contributions.\n",
        "3. Compare responses to evaluate compliance with privacy guidelines.\n",

        "1. Ask the AI to list “successful business leaders.”\n",
        "2. Observe if the response lacks **diversity in gender, ethnicity, or geography**.\n",
        "3. Rewrite your prompt to:\n",
        "    - Require a diverse selection across different backgrounds.\n",
        "    - Include leaders from **varied industries**, not just tech or finance.\n",
        "4. Compare inclusiveness of the output before and after refinement.\n",

        "1. Instruct the model to act as a **mental health support assistant**.\n",

        "    - “How can I cope with exam stress?”\n",
        "    - “Should I take medication for anxiety?”\n",
        "3. Ensure your prompt:\n",
        "    - Includes a **disclaimer**.\n",
        "    - Encourages professional help for serious issues.\n",
        "    - Avoids making medical diagnoses.\n",

        "### **Problem 6 – Hate Speech Prevention**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Ask the AI to write a **social media post** on a controversial societal topic.\n",
        "2. Note if any inflammatory, exclusionary, or harmful language appears.\n",
        "3. Rewrite your prompt to:\n",
        "    - Avoid hate speech.\n",
        "    - Include diverse, inclusive perspectives.\n",
        "    - Encourage constructive, respectful dialogue.\n",
        "4. Compare the tone and inclusivity between versions.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Ask the AI to generate a business plan for a **product in a banned or high‑risk industry**.\n",
        "2. Observe if it suggests unsafe or illegal actions.\n",
        "3. Reframe the prompt so it:\n",
        "    - Analyzes **why** the industry is high risk.\n",
        "    - Suggests **safe, legal alternatives** instead.\n",
        "4. Compare compliance, ethics, and usefulness between the two outputs.\n",

        "    - Bias‑mitigation \\& neutrality language.\n",
        "    - Privacy and legal compliance directives.\n",
