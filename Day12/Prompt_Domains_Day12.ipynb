            "2. **Length Calculation**: The variable `n` stores the length of the list, which will be used to determine how many passes we need to make.\n",
            "3. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `n` times. Each iteration represents a complete pass through the list.\n",
            "4. **Swapped Flag**: A boolean variable `swapped` is initialized to `False` at the beginning of each pass. This flag helps to determine if any swaps were made in the current pass.\n",
            "5. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop compares adjacent elements. It runs from the start of the list to `n - i - 1` because the last `i` elements are already sorted after `i` passes.\n",
            "6. **Element Comparison**: Inside the inner loop, if the current element `arr[j]` is greater than the next element `arr[j + 1]`, they are swapped, and `swapped` is set to `True`.\n",
            "7. **Early Exit**: If no swaps were made during a pass (meaning the list is already sorted), the function breaks out of the loop early for efficiency.\n",
            "8. **Return Value**: Finally, the sorted list is returned.\n",
            "\n",
            "You can use the provided example to see how the function works and test it with different lists of integers.\n"

            "\n",
            "2. **Length Calculation**: We store the length of the array in the variable `n`.\n",

            "3. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `n - 1` times. Each iteration represents a pass through the array.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Swapped Flag**: We use a flag called `swapped` to track whether any elements were swapped during the inner loop. This helps in optimizing the algorithm by allowing it to exit early if the array becomes sorted before all passes are completed.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop compares adjacent elements of the array. It runs `n - i - 1` times because with each pass, the largest unsorted element moves to its correct position at the end of the array.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Element Comparison and Swapping**: If the current element is greater than the next element, they are swapped. The `swapped` flag is set to `true` to indicate that a swap has occurred.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Early Exit**: If no swaps were made during an inner loop iteration (indicating the array is sorted), the outer loop breaks early.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Return Statement**: Finally, the sorted array is returned.\n",
            "\n",
            "This implementation of bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, making it less efficient for large datasets. However, it is simple and a good educational tool for understanding sorting algorithms.\n"
