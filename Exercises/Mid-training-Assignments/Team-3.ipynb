        "# ETL Lab Exercise: Global Superstore Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "## Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "In this exercise, you will build an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipeline in Google Colab using the publicly available \"Global Superstore\" dataset, which contains sales transactions, customer, and product data from a fictional worldwide retail store.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tasks\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Extract\n",
        "- **Download:**  \n",
        "  Download the Global Superstore dataset CSV from this public URL:  \n",
        "  [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/superstore_sales.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/superstore_sales.csv)  \n",
        "- **Load:**  \n",
        "  Load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Transform\n",
        "- **Clean:**  \n",
        "  - Handle missing or inconsistent data entries.  \n",
        "  - Rename columns for clarity if needed.  \n",
        "  - Convert date columns (e.g., Order Date, Ship Date) to datetime format.\n",
        "- **Feature Engineering:**  \n",
        "  - Calculate `OrderProcessingTime` as the difference between Ship Date and Order Date in days.  \n",
        "  - Categorize sales into \"Low\", \"Medium\", and \"High\" based on quantiles of `Sales`.  \n",
        "  - Extract the year and month from the order date for time series analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Load\n",
        "- **SQLite Storage:**  \n",
        "  Store the transformed DataFrame inside a local SQLite database within Colab.  \n",
        "- **SQL Queries:**  \n",
        "  - Retrieve total sales by region and category.  \n",
        "  - Find the average order processing time by segment.  \n",
        "  - List the top 5 customers by total sales.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Constraints\n",
        "\n",
        "- All ETL steps must be performed using pandas, SQLite, and Python standard libraries within Colab only.  \n",
        "- Do not use any external cloud database or services.\n",

        "---\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example Challenge Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "- Which region has the highest total sales overall?  \n",
        "- What is the average order processing time for different customer segments?  \n",
        "- Which products contribute most to revenue in each category?\n",

        "**Expected Outcome:**  \n",
        "By completing this lab, you will build practical skills in data ingestion, cleaning, feature engineering, and local database management â€” all using a real-world retail dataset inside Google Colab.\n"
