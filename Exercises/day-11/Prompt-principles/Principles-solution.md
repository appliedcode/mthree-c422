## **ðŸ’¡ Solutions: Prompt Engineering Principles with Sample Datasets**


***

### **1. Give Clear Direction**

**Dataset:** Renewable energy article snippet

**Vague Prompt:**

``` 
Write about energy.
```

**Sample Output:**
> Energy is important because it powers our homes, cars, and industries. There are many types of energy like electricity, heat, and solar energyâ€¦

**Clear Direction Prompt:**

```

**Sample Output:**
> Renewable energy comes from sources that wonâ€™t run out, such as sunlight, wind, and flowing water. Solar panels turn sunlight into electricity. Wind turbines use moving air to spin blades that generate power. Hydropower comes from dams that use moving water to produce energy. These methods reduce pollution and help fight climate change. They are sustainable, meaning they can provide power for generations without depleting natural resources.
