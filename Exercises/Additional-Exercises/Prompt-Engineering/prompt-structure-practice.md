## üìö Student Self-Practice: Mastering Prompt Structure

**Objective:**
Independently experiment with each key element of prompt structure and observe how it changes model behavior.

***

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clarity ‚Äî Removing Ambiguity

**Task:**
Write two prompts asking for an explanation of ‚Äúmachine learning‚Äù:

- One vague and general
- One precise and clear, specifying audience and format
**Question:** Which gives more relevant and focused output?

***

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Context ‚Äî Adding Background

**Task:**
Ask the model to describe climate change **without context**.
Then, re-ask but add background, such as:

- Who the audience is (e.g., primary school students)
- Purpose (e.g., prepare for a classroom presentation)
**Question:** How did adding context change tone, examples, and complexity?

***

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Constraints ‚Äî Limiting the Response

**Task:**
Request the model to list benefits of clean energy:

- First, **no constraints**.
- Then, require **exactly 4 bullet points**, **no more than 6 words each**.
**Question:** Did the constrained version meet all rules? If not, why might that happen?

***

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Organization ‚Äî Structuring the Prompt

**Task:**
Create a structured prompt with three sections:

```
### Instruction:
...
### Context:
...
### Output Format:
...
```

Choose your own topic and format style (e.g., numbered list, paragraph, table).
**Question:** Did separating sections improve how closely the model followed your request?

***

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Prefixes \& Labels ‚Äî Explicit Input/Output Formatting

**Task:**
Use Q/A style labeling or ‚ÄúExample 1 / Example 2‚Äù style few-shot prompts to teach a specific format.
Then give a **new input** and check if the model sticks to that format.
**Question:** How consistent was the output with the examples you provided?

***

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Decomposition ‚Äî Breaking Tasks into Steps

**Task:**
Pick a complex question (e.g., ‚ÄúHow to start a small online business‚Äù).

- First: Ask the model directly for the answer.
- Then: Break it into **Step 1, Step 2‚Ä¶** sub-prompts with clear goals for each.
**Question:** Which approach gave more thorough, actionable output? Was accuracy better with step-by-step prompting?

***

## üîç Reflection

For each exercise:

- What changed in the outputs between your two attempts?
- Which single trick (clarity, context, constraints, organization, labels, decomposition) had the **biggest positive impact** on quality?
- Which was hardest to get right?

***

üí° **Tip for Students:**
Try combining multiple techniques ‚Äî e.g., **Clarity + Context + Constraints**, or **Organization + Decomposition** ‚Äî and see if results improve even more.
