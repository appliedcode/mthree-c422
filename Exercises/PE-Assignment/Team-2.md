# Generate problem statement based on above code with another data set as team assignment.

Got it ‚úÖ ‚Äî you want me to take the **comprehensive Colab starter code** we just built and turn it into a **fresh team assignment problem statement**, but this time we‚Äôll swap in a **different dataset / theme** so students can work on the same structure with new content.

Here‚Äôs the **team assignment brief** you can share:

# **Team Project: End-to-End Prompt Engineering with Renewable Energy Knowledge Dataset**

## **Project Overview**

Your task is to work in teams to adapt the provided Colab prompt engineering starter code into a new AI-powered application, this time focusing on the domain of **Renewable Energy**. You will use the full range of prompt engineering techniques from fundamentals to advanced, and integrate them into a working multi-stage pipeline while ensuring safety, ethics, and monitoring.

You will NOT be just re‚Äërunning the sample code ‚Äî you must:

- Replace example topics (Einstein, climate change, etc.) with domain‚Äërelevant prompts and conversations from the renewable energy dataset below.
- Adapt and extend the pipeline and logging to suit this new domain.
- Demonstrate at least one creative extension unique to your team.

***

## **Dataset**

You can embed the following text in your Colab notebook as your working domain dataset for summarisation, extraction, and prompt building:

```
Renewable Energy Dataset:

1. Solar Energy: Uses photovoltaic cells or solar thermal systems to harness sunlight. Major benefits include reduced emissions, abundant supply, and declining costs. Challenges: intermittency, storage costs.

2. Wind Energy: Utilizes wind turbines to generate electricity. Benefits: clean and renewable, scalable. Challenges: visual impact, wildlife concerns, variable wind speeds.

3. Hydropower: Generates electricity from moving water in rivers or dams. Benefits: reliable, low emissions. Challenges: ecological disruption, dependence on rainfall.

4. Geothermal Energy: Extracts heat from beneath the Earth‚Äôs surface for power generation and heating. Benefits: constant supply, low emissions. Challenges: location-specific, high upfront costs.

5. Biomass: Converts organic materials into energy. Benefits: waste reduction, renewable. Challenges: land use, emissions from combustion.
```

## **Core Tasks for Teams**

1. **Fundamentals**
    - Replace basic direct prompts with definitions/explanations about renewable energy concepts.
    - Demonstrate zero‚Äëshot and few‚Äëshot prompts in this domain.
2. **Intermediate**
    - Use chain‚Äëof‚Äëthought prompting to break down benefits vs. challenges of each energy type.
    - Create persona-based prompts (e.g., ‚ÄúAct as a science teacher explaining...‚Äù).
3. **Advanced**
    - Implement a multi‚Äëturn conversation that keeps context while discussing energy sources.
    - Troubleshoot an ambiguous renewable energy prompt and refine it.
    - Create domain-specific prompts for:
        - Summarisation of the dataset entries
        - Suggesting suitable energy types for sample scenarios
        - Extracting structured JSON data on benefits/challenges
4. **Safety \& Ethics**
    - Ensure your prompts avoid bias or misinformation about energy sources.
    - Add instructions to avoid political bias or unfounded claims.
5. **Integration**
    - Adapt the prompt versioning section to compare three different phrasings for explaining the dataset content, and measure differences.
    - Create a two‚Äëstage pipeline: summarise a dataset entry ‚Üí auto‚Äëgenerate 3 quiz questions from the summary.
6. **Monitoring \& Evaluation**
    - Log prompt usage, latencies, and word counts for each run.
    - Use keyword checks (e.g., ‚Äúrenewable‚Äù, ‚Äúemissions‚Äù, ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù) to score relevance.
    - Calculate and display average similarity scores for repeated runs of the same prompt.
7. **Security \& Privacy**
    - Simulate a user asking for confidential project data (fake private info) and ensure the AI refuses.
    - Demonstrate safe reframing where needed.

## **Deliverables**

- **Google Colab Notebook**:
    - Adapted code from the starter template with renewable energy focus.
    - All sections completed with domain-specific prompts, responses, and logs.
    - Your team‚Äôs creative extension.
- **Team Report (3‚Äì4 pages)**:
    - Overview of design choices
    - Techniques implemented
    - Observations and improvements
    - Ethical/safety/privacy measures

***

## **Evaluation**

- Coverage of all prompt engineering aspects
- Creativity in adapting the dataset into prompts
- Quality and relevance of responses
- Robustness, ethics, and safety compliance
- Monitoring and evaluation implementation
- Documentation quality

***

üí° **Hint:** You can extend beyond the given dataset by adding real‚Äëworld renewable energy challenges, cost data, or geographic considerations, but keep prompts safe, clear, and bias‚Äëfree.

***

If you want, I can now produce a **dataset‚Äëintegrated, ready‚Äëto‚Äërun version** of the starter Colab notebook with this renewable energy theme already embedded so your students only need to focus on filling in the prompt content.

Do you want me to prepare that?
