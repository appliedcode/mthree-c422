## NLP Assignment: Binary Sentiment Classification using Transformers on the Yelp Reviews Polarity Dataset

### Problem Statement:

In this assignment, you will explore Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques by performing binary sentiment classification on the **Yelp Reviews Polarity** dataset. This dataset contains Yelp user reviews labeled with positive or negative sentiment, making it a great example for learning sentiment analysis with Transformers.

Your task is to preprocess the raw review texts, tokenize them for Transformer input, fine-tune a pretrained Transformer model (e.g., BERT) to classify reviews as either positive or negative, and evaluate the model’s performance using relevant metrics. This assignment will help you solidify knowledge in binary text classification using Transformer architectures in a real-world sentiment analysis context.

### Dataset Details:

- **Yelp Reviews Polarity Dataset:**
    - Contains hundreds of thousands of Yelp reviews.
    - Reviews are labeled as either positive or negative sentiment (binary classification).
    - The dataset is balanced and freely available through libraries such as Huggingface `datasets`.


### Task Objectives:

1. **Load and Preprocess the Dataset:**
    - Load the Yelp Reviews Polarity dataset using Huggingface’s `datasets` library.
    - Optionally clean review texts by removing noise or special characters.
    - Tokenize the reviews using a pretrained Transformer tokenizer (e.g., `BertTokenizer`) with padding and truncation to a fixed max length (e.g., 128 tokens).
2. **Model Fine-Tuning:**
    - Load a pretrained Transformer model suited for sequence classification (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`) configured for binary outputs.
    - Fine-tune the model on the training split of the dataset.
3. **Evaluation:**
    - Evaluate the model on the test split using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    - Optionally, generate a confusion matrix to visualize classification results.
4. **Optional Extension:**
    - Briefly explore how audio-based sentiment detection using MFCC features relates to text-based sentiment analysis, providing insights into multimodal emotion recognition.

### Hints and Guidance:

- Use Huggingface’s `datasets.load_dataset("yelp_polarity")` for easy access.
- Employ `BertTokenizer` from Huggingface’s `transformers` library for consistent tokenization with padding and truncation.
- Fine-tune the model with reasonable batch sizes (8-16) over 2-3 epochs to balance accuracy and runtime.
- Utilize Huggingface’s `Trainer` API for smooth training and evaluation workflow.
- Use `sklearn.metrics` or the Trainer’s built-in compute_metrics utilities for evaluation.
- Analyze misclassified samples for deeper understanding.
- Ensure the assignment is achievable within about one hour.

This assignment provides a hands-on experience with binary text classification leveraging robust Transformer models and a large-scale real-world sentiment dataset. Let me know if you want me to prepare a ready-to-run Colab notebook snippet for this task.
