        "*   The notebook successfully covers three key text vectorization techniques: Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and N-grams.\n",
        "*   Markdown cells provide clear explanations of each technique, including their mechanisms, advantages, and disadvantages.\n",
        "*   Code cells demonstrate the practical application of each technique using a simple sample corpus and the `sklearn` library.\n",
        "*   The code examples generate and display the resulting vector representations (word counts, TF-IDF scores, and n-gram counts) in both sparse and dense formats, including readable pandas DataFrames.\n",
        "*   A comparison section highlights the key differences and use cases for each technique.\n",
        "*   Visualizations using heatmaps effectively illustrate the differences in the numerical representations generated by each method for the sample corpus.\n",
        "*   The notebook concludes with a summary of key takeaways and common applications in NLP.\n",

        "*   Consider adding a section on other vectorization techniques like Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) or contextual embeddings (BERT) to provide a more comprehensive overview of modern approaches.\n",
        "*   Explore the impact of preprocessing steps (like stop word removal, stemming, or lemmatization) on the vectorization results for each technique.\n"
