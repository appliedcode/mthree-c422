# Instructor Transcript: 03_vectorization_techniques.ipynb

## Learning Objectives
Participants learn to convert text into numerical vectors for machine learning. The session covers Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, n-grams, and feature visualization.

## Why Vectorize Text?
The notebook explains the need for vectorization and compares different approaches, highlighting their strengths and use cases.

## Practical Steps
- Build document-term matrices (BoW).
- Apply TF-IDF weighting.
- Extract n-grams for phrase-level analysis.
- Visualize word frequencies and feature importance.
- Compare vectorization methods for different NLP tasks.
