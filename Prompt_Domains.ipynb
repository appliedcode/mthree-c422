            "\n",
            "1. **Function Definition**: The function `bubble_sort` takes a single argument `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Length Calculation**: The length of the list is stored in `n` to determine how many iterations are needed.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop iterates over each element of the list. The variable `i` keeps track of how many passes have been made.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Swapping Flag**: A boolean variable `swapped` is initialized to `False` at the start of each outer loop iteration. This flag is used to check if any swaps were made during the inner loop.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop compares adjacent elements in the list. It runs from the beginning of the list to `n - i - 1`, as the last `i` elements are already sorted.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Comparison and Swap**: If the current element is greater than the next one, they are swapped, and the `swapped` flag is set to `True`.\n",
            "\n",

            "3. **Swapping Flag**: A flag `swapped` is initialized to `false` at the start of each outer loop iteration. This flag helps to determine if any swaps occurred during the inner loop.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop compares adjacent elements. It runs from the start of the array to `n-1-i`, where `i` is the current pass number. This is because with each pass, the largest unsorted element \"bubbles up\" to its correct position, so we can skip checking the last `i` elements.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Comparison and Swap**: If the current element is greater than the next element, they are swapped. The flag `swapped` is set to `true` to indicate a swap has occurred.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Early Termination**: If no elements were swapped during a pass (i.e., the array is already sorted), the loop breaks early for optimization.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Return Value**: The sorted array is returned after completing the sorting process.\n",
            "\n",
