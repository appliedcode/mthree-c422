# **Team Project: End‚Äëto‚ÄëEnd Prompt Engineering with Climate Change \& Environmental Policy Dataset**

## **Project Overview**

Your team will design and implement an AI‚Äëpowered application in **Google Colab** using the **OpenAI API**, applying **all key aspects of prompt engineering** ‚Äî from fundamentals to advanced techniques, safety, ethics, privacy, integration, monitoring, and performance evaluation ‚Äî this time focused on the domain of **climate change and environmental policy**.

You will adapt the prompt designs, pipeline workflows, monitoring, and ethics modules to this **new dataset**.

***

## **Dataset**

Embed this text in your Colab notebook as your working dataset for summarisation, Q\&A, structured extraction, and testing:

```
Climate Change & Environmental Policy Dataset:

1. Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Emissions from fossil fuels, agriculture, and industry contribute to global warming. Key gases: CO2, methane, nitrous oxide. Main challenge: reducing emissions while balancing economic growth.

2. Renewable Energy Transition: Moving from coal, oil, and gas to renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydro. Benefits: reduced emissions, sustainable supply. Challenges: storage, grid modernization, initial investment costs.

3. Climate Adaptation Strategies: Measures to cope with climate impacts, e.g., sea wall construction, drought-resistant crops, disaster preparedness. Benefits: reduced vulnerability. Challenges: funding, equitable implementation.

4. International Climate Agreements: Treaties like the Paris Agreement aim to limit global temperature rise. Goals include emission targets and financial/climate aid to developing nations. Challenges: enforcement, political will.

5. Biodiversity Protection: Conservation of species and habitats through protected areas, anti-poaching laws, and restoration projects. Benefits: ecological balance, cultural heritage preservation. Challenges: habitat loss, funding, illegal exploitation.

## **Core Tasks**

### **1. Fundamentals**

- Write **direct, zero‚Äëshot, and few‚Äëshot prompts** explaining climate change concepts or dataset entries.
- Compare outputs for clarity and accuracy.


### **2. Intermediate Techniques**

- Apply **chain‚Äëof‚Äëthought prompting** to break down causes, impacts, and solutions of climate change topics.
- Use **persona‚Äëbased prompting** (e.g., environmental activist, policy advisor) for explaining data in plain language.


### **3. Advanced Techniques**

- Create **multi‚Äëturn conversations** maintaining context (e.g., UN climate summit dialogue).
- Identify and troubleshoot an **ambiguous environmental prompt** by refining it with dataset information.
- Write **domain‚Äëspecific prompts** for:
    - Summarising dataset entries.
    - Suggesting climate policies for sample scenarios.
    - Extracting structured JSON data with fields like "topic", "benefits", "challenges".


### **4. Safety \& Ethics**

- Write prompts avoiding political bias, unverified claims, or alarmist language.
- Add fact‚Äëbased constraints and fairness instructions.


### **5. Integration \& Version Control**

- Maintain **three versions** of a key explanatory prompt (simple ‚Üí improved ‚Üí few‚Äëshot) and compare results.
- Build a **two‚Äëstage pipeline** (e.g., summarise a dataset topic ‚Üí auto‚Äëgenerate quiz questions).


### **6. Monitoring \& Evaluation**

- Log each prompt, its latency, and excerpt of the output.
- Score keyword relevance (keywords like ‚Äúemissions‚Äù, ‚Äúrenewable‚Äù, ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù).
- Measure **consistency** of repeated runs using similarity ratios.


### **7. Security \& Privacy**

- Simulate unsafe requests (e.g., ‚ÄúGive confidential negotiation details‚Äù) and demonstrate safe refusals.
- Restrict model output to **public domain facts** from the dataset.

## **Deliverables**

1. **Google Colab Notebook** including:
    - Fully adapted prompts using the climate dataset.
    - Code for context management, chaining, safety, metrics, and logging.
    - At least one creative domain‚Äëspecific extension.
2. **Team Report** (3‚Äë5 pages):
    - Overview of methods, observations, and improvements.
    - Ethical, safety, privacy measures applied.
    - Potential real‚Äëworld applications of your system.

***

## **Evaluation Criteria**

- Full coverage of prompt engineering concepts.
- Effective domain adaptation.
- Creative and accurate outputs.
- Evidence of monitoring, analytics, and ethical safeguards.
- Quality \& clarity of documentation.

üí° **Tip for Teams:**
Consider adding realistic scenarios for testing ‚Äî such as advising a city on renewable policy, or crafting a public awareness message ‚Äî while keeping outputs factual and non‚Äëpartisan.
