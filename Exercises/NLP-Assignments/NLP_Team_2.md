## NLP Assignment: Multi-Class Text Classification using Transformers on the Reuters-21578 Dataset

### Problem Statement:

In this assignment, you will explore Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques by performing multi-class text classification on the widely used **Reuters-21578** dataset. This dataset contains thousands of newswire articles labeled with multiple categories such as economics, corporate, government, and others.

Your task is to preprocess the raw text data, tokenize it for Transformer input, fine-tune a pretrained Transformer model (e.g., BERT) to classify texts into relevant categories, and evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate metrics. This assignment will help you understand applying Transformer architectures to real-world text classification problems, especially with imbalanced or multi-labeled data.

### Dataset Details:

- **Reuters-21578 Dataset:**
    - Comprises about 21,578 manually categorized news articles.
    - Articles are labeled with multiple topics (~90 categories).
    - Widely used for text categorization and multi-label classification tasks.
    - Relatively imbalanced categories, providing experience with real-world NLP challenges.


### Task Objectives:

1. **Load and Preprocess the Dataset:**
    - Load the Reuters-21578 dataset via libraries such as `nltk.corpus` or Huggingface’s `datasets`.
    - Optionally clean and preprocess texts (remove headers, special characters).
    - Handle multi-label targets by selecting top categories or converting labels appropriately.
    - Tokenize the dataset using a pretrained Transformer tokenizer (e.g., `BertTokenizer`) with padding and truncation to a fixed maximum sequence length (e.g., 128 tokens).
2. **Model Fine-Tuning:**
    - Load a pretrained Transformer model suitable for sequence classification (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`).
    - Adapt the classification head for multi-label classification by setting the appropriate output dimension and activation (like sigmoid).
    - Fine-tune the model on the training portion of the dataset.
3. **Evaluation:**
    - Evaluate model performance using multi-label metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (micro, macro), and analyze the confusion matrix per category.
    - Optionally handle class imbalance with weighted loss or sampling techniques.
4. **Optional Extension:**
    - Briefly discuss or demonstrate audio feature extraction techniques (e.g., MFCCs) and their relevance to emotion or sentiment recognition, to extend your perspective to multimodal NLP tasks.

### Hints and Guidance:

- Use `nltk.corpus.reuters` or Huggingface’s `datasets` to load Reuters-21578 data.
- Focus on a subset of the top frequent categories if the full label set is too large or sparse to manage easily.
- Use `BertTokenizer` for consistent tokenization with padding and truncation.
- For multi-label classification, use loss functions like BCEWithLogitsLoss and adjust the model’s output layer accordingly.
- Leverage Huggingface `Trainer` API with custom compute_metrics to handle multi-label evaluation.
- Configure training parameters (batch size ~8-16, 2-3 epochs, suitable learning rate) to balance training time and accuracy.
- Analyze misclassifications to understand errors and improve the model.
- Keep the scope manageable to complete within roughly 1 hour but encourage exploration beyond basics.
