# ðŸŽ¬ Session: Movie Reviews Sentiment Classification

### **Learning Objectives:**

- Understand various text classification algorithms (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)
- Implement train/test splits and cross-validation
- Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC and AUC
- Practice multi-class and binary sentiment classification
- Compare feature extraction methods like Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and n-grams
- Experiment with preprocessing pipelines including stopword removal, lemmatization, and stemming
- Visualize results with confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance
- Use cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to select best models


### **Dataset Description:**

You will work with a movie review dataset containing user reviews labeled as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** sentiments. The dataset consists of roughly 300 movie reviews balanced across these three classes. Sample reviews include opinions about acting, storyline, visual effects, and overall enjoyment.

Example reviews:

- "I absolutely loved this film! The story was compelling and the acting superb." (Positive)
- "The movie was boring and slow-paced; I wouldnâ€™t recommend it." (Negative)
- "It was an okay movie â€” nothing special but watchable." (Neutral)


### **Proposed Exercises:**

#### Exercise 1: **Implement a Basic Text Classification Pipeline**

- Preprocess the movie reviews using text cleaning, stopword removal, and lemmatization
- Vectorize the text using TF-IDF
- Train a Naive Bayes classifier
- Evaluate the model on accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and confusion matrix
- Visualize the confusion matrix


#### Exercise 2: **Model Comparison Framework**

- Train and evaluate multiple classifiers (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN)
- Use stratified k-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Compare model performances with F1-score and accuracy
- Visualize comparison metrics with bar plots


#### Exercise 3: **Advanced Feature Engineering**

- Compare Bag-of-Words vs TF-IDF vectorization
- Experiment with different n-gram ranges (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams)
- Test effects of various preprocessing combinations (stopwords removal, stemming, lemmatization)
- Analyze feature importance for the best-performing model


#### Exercise 4: **Sentiment Classification with Confidence Analysis**

- Train models capable of outputting probabilities (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM with probability=True)
- Evaluate ROC curves and AUC scores for binary and multi-class settings
- Analyze model confidence distributions
- Implement prediction with confidence scores on custom movie review inputs


#### Exercise 5: **Robust Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning**

- Create sklearn pipelines combining vectorization and classifiers
- Perform grid search for hyperparameters across multiple models
- Use stratified cross-validation splits
- Generate comprehensive evaluation reports
- Select the best model based on macro F1-score
- Visualize cross-validation results


### **Dataset Source:**

You can use publicly available movie reviews datasets such as:

- [IMDb Movie Review Dataset (small balanced subset)](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
- Or create a custom dataset by scraping reviews from trusted movie review sites (e.g., Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic)


### **Additional Notes:**

- Emphasize reproducibility by setting random seeds for train/test splits and model training
- Use NLTK or spaCy for natural language preprocessing
- Visualizations with matplotlib or seaborn enhance understanding of model behavior
- Document your code and results for easy sharing and reproducibility

If you'd like, I can also help generate the full code skeleton and implementations tailored for this movie review sentiment classification project! Just let me know.
