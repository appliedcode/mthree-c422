# Instructor Transcript: 02_text_cleaning_tokenization.ipynb

## Learning Objectives
This session focuses on text cleaning and tokenization, foundational steps in any NLP pipeline. Participants learn to handle noisy, inconsistent, and unstructured text.

## What is Text Preprocessing?
The notebook explains why preprocessing is crucial, introduces common text issues, and demonstrates how to transform raw text into a clean, analyzable format.

## Practical Steps
- Use regex and string methods for cleaning.
- Tokenize text with NLTK and spaCy.
- Handle emails, URLs, and social media text.
- Build reusable preprocessing pipelines.
- Compare different tokenization approaches.
