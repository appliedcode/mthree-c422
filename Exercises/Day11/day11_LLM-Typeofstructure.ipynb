Here’s a simple step-by-step guide to baking a basic cake:\n","\n","### Step 1: Gather Ingredients and Tools\n","- **Ingredients**: \n","  - 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour\n","  - 1 cup granulated sugar\n","  - ½ cup unsalted butter (softened)\n","  - 2 large eggs\n","  - 1 cup milk\n","  - 2 teaspoons baking powder\n","  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n","  - ½ teaspoon salt\n","- **Tools**: Mixing bowls, measuring cups and spoons, whisk or electric mixer, 9-inch round cake pans, and parchment paper (optional).\n","\n","### Step 2: Preheat the Oven\n","- Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures the oven is at the right temperature when you’re ready to bake.\n","\n","### Step 3: Prepare the Cake Pans\n","- Grease the bottom and sides of the cake pans with butter or non-stick spray. For easier removal, line the bottom with parchment paper and grease it as well.\n","\n","### Step 4: Mix the Batter\n","1. In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy.\n","2. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.\n","3. Stir in the vanilla extract.\n","4. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt.\n","5. Gradually add the dry mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk. Mix until just combined.\n","\n","### Step 5: Pour and Bake\n","- Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\n","\n","### Step 6: Cool and Frost\n","- Once baked, remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, turn them out onto wire racks to cool completely. Once cooled, you can frost and decorate the cake as desired.\n","\n","Enjoy your delicious homemade cake!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Exercise 2 – Examples (Few‑Shot) Pattern\n","few_shot = \"\"\"Translate English → Kannada.\n","\n","English: Hello !\n","Kannada: Namaskara !\n","\n","English: Where is you home?\n","Kannada: Nimma mane yelli ?\n","\n","English: My name is Rania.\n","Kannada:\"\"\"\n","\n","resp = client.chat.completions.create(\n","    model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n","    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": few_shot}],\n","    max_tokens=50\n",")\n","print(resp.choices[0].message.content)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"C3FyrQo8e4yB","outputId":"67c63bc0-a901-4526-d1f6-ef7127ba7cd9","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754901017223,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":546,"user":{"displayName":"Rania","userId":"13750069140470329881"}}},"execution_count":31,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Nanna hesaru Rania.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Exercise 3 – Persona Pattern\n","prompt = \"You are Ada Lovelace writing a 120-word diary entry about today’s AI advancements.\"\n","resp = client.chat.completions.create(\n","    model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n","    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n","    max_tokens=200\n",")\n","print(resp.choices[0].message.content)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"fjjoAIZFfBvo","outputId":"5c9c8645-c26a-4fe1-c475-379571e70d0a","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754901012709,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3539,"user":{"displayName":"Rania","userId":"13750069140470329881"}}},"execution_count":30,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["October 2023\n","\n","Today, I marvel at the advancements in artificial intelligence, which seem to mirror my earliest visions of computing.
