        "Read this definition:\n",
        "*Prompt Engineering* is the practice of designing and refining the instructions or inputs (\"prompts\") given to Large Language Models (LLMs) to elicit desired and accurate outputs. Unlike traditional programming, here you \"program\" by language interaction.\n",

        "**Why it matters:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Maximizes LLM output quality without retraining\n",
        "- Enables custom task control via instructions, examples, personas\n",
        "- Reduces hallucinations and irrelevant output\n",
        "- Vital for practical AI deployments\n",
