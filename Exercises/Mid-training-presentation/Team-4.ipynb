        "\n",
        "In this exercise, you'll build an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipeline in Google Colab, using real-world trip data from New York City's iconic yellow taxis.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 1. Extract\n",
        "- **Download:**  \n",
        "  Download a recent sample NYC Yellow Taxi Trip data CSV from this public direct URL:  \n",
        "  [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/kxp8-n2sj/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/kxp8-n2sj/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD)\n",
        "- **Load:**  \n",
        "  Load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Transform\n",
        "- **Clean:**  \n",
        "  - Handle missing or inconsistent values in key columns (like fare amount, trip distance, passenger count).\n",
        "  - Convert date columns (e.g., pickup/dropoff datetime) to proper datetime format.\n",
        "  - Remove records that aren't plausible (e.g., zero or negative trip distance or fare).\n",
        "- **Feature Engineering:**  \n",
        "  - Compute trip duration in minutes.\n",
        "  - Create a new feature called `Tip_Percent` as `tip_amount/total_amount * 100`.\n",
        "  - Categorize each ride by time of day (\"Morning\", \"Afternoon\", \"Evening\", \"Night\") using the pickup timestamp.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Load\n",
        "- **SQLite Storage:**  \n",
        "  Store the transformed DataFrame in a local SQLite database in Colab.\n",
        "- **SQL Queries:**  \n",
        "  - What is the average fare by time-of-day category?\n",
        "  - What is the distribution of tip percentages?\n",
        "  - Which hour of the day sees the highest average trip duration?\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Constraints\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use only pandas, Python standard library, and SQLite inside Google Colab.\n",
        "- Do not use external databases or cloud services.\n",
