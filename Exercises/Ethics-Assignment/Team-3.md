## Team Case Study Assignment: Ethical Challenges in AI Hiring Systems — The Amazon Recruiting AI Incident

### Overview

Your team will act as an AI Ethics advisory group tasked with analyzing the ethical, legal, and societal challenges exposed by the deployment of AI-based hiring tools, focusing on the well-documented case of Amazon’s AI recruiting system. This tool was ultimately scrapped after it was found to systematically discriminate against women, penalizing resumes that included terms related to women’s activities or colleges and replicating gender biases from historical hiring data.

You will critically examine how bias infiltrates AI hiring systems, the harm caused to underrepresented groups, and the responsibility of organizations in ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability in automated recruitment.

### Case Study Context

Amazon’s recruiting AI was trained on a decade of historical hiring data dominated by male candidates. The system learned to downgrade resumes containing words like “women’s chess club” or references to female-oriented colleges, reflecting and perpetuating gender bias rather than mitigating it.

This real-world failure highlights significant challenges including:

- Biased training data replicating societal inequalities
- Lack of transparency in AI decision-making
- Ethical and legal implications of automated discrimination
- Risks of opaque AI systems impacting diversity and inclusion goals
