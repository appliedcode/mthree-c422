Imagine a regular computer as a super-fast librarian that helps you find books. It uses tiny bits of information called \"bits,\" which can be either a 0 or a 1, like a light switch that‚Äôs either off or on.\n","\n","Now, let‚Äôs think about quantum computing. It‚Äôs like having a magical librarian who can look through many books at the same time! This is because it uses \"qubits,\" which are special and can be both 0 and 1 at the same time, kind of like spinning coins that are both heads and tails while they‚Äôre spinning.\n","\n","Because of this special ability, quantum computers can solve certain problems a lot faster than regular computers. They‚Äôre really good at things like cracking codes, simulating molecules in chemistry, or solving complex puzzles. However, they are still very new and not used for everything yet.\n","\n","So, to sum it up: regular computers are like fast librarians, while quantum computers are like magical librarians who can do many things at once!\n","\n","==================================================\n","\n","üë∂ For 5-year-old:\n","Okay! Imagine you have a really big box of toys, and you want to find your favorite toy car. Normally, you would have to look at each toy one by one until you find it. That could take a long time!\n","\n","Now, think of quantum computing like having a magical friend who can look at all the toys at the same time. This friend can help you find your toy car way faster than you could by yourself!\n","\n","In a simple way, quantum computers are super smart and can do many things at once, like your magical friend, which helps solve big problems much quicker than regular computers.\n","\n","==================================================\n","\n","üéì For college student:\n","Sure! Quantum computing is an exciting field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in fundamentally different ways compared to classical computing.\n","\n","### Classical vs. Quantum Computing\n","\n","1. **Bits vs. Qubits**:\n","   - In classical computing, the basic unit of information is the **bit**, which can be either a 0 or a 1. This binary system is the foundation of all classical computation.\n","   - In quantum computing, the basic unit is the **qubit** (quantum bit). A qubit can exist in a state of 0, 1, or any quantum superposition of these states. This means that a qubit can represent both 0 and 1 at the same time, to varying degrees.\n","\n","2. **Superposition**:\n","   - Superposition is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. It allows qubits to hold multiple states simultaneously. For example, if you have two qubits, they can represent four possible states (00, 01, 10, 11) at the same time, thanks to superposition. With n qubits, you can represent 2^n states simultaneously.\n","\n","3. **Entanglement**:\n","   - Another key principle is **entanglement**, which occurs when qubits become interconnected in such a way that the state of one qubit instantly influences the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. This property can be used to perform complex calculations more efficiently than classical systems.\n","\n","4. **Quantum Gates**:\n","   - Just like classical computers use logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) to manipulate bits, quantum computers use **quantum gates** to perform operations on qubits. These gates manipulate the probabilities of a qubit's state, allowing for the construction of quantum circuits.\n","\n","5. **Quantum Algorithms**:\n","   - Quantum computing has the potential to solve certain problems significantly faster than classical computers. For instance, **Shor's algorithm** can factor large numbers exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms, which has implications for cryptography. **Grover's algorithm** can search unsorted databases in O(‚àöN) time, providing a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms.\n","\n","### Advantages and Challenges\n","\n","- **Advantages**:\n","  - Potential for solving complex problems in cryptography, optimization, material science, and more.\n","  - Parallelism due to superposition allows quantum computers to explore many possibilities simultaneously.\n","\n","- **Challenges**:\n","  - **Decoherence**: Qubits are sensitive to their environment and can lose their quantum state due to interference, leading to errors in computation.\n","  - **Error Correction**: Developing effective quantum error correction techniques is crucial for reliable computations.\n","  - **Scalability**: Building scalable quantum systems with a large number of qubits while maintaining coherence is a significant engineering challenge.\n","\n","### Current State of Quantum Computing\n","\n","As of now, quantum computing is still in its early stages. Several companies and research institutions are working on developing practical quantum computers, but these machines are currently limited in size and capability. However, the field is rapidly evolving, and there are promising advancements in quantum hardware and algorithms.\n","\n","### Conclusion\n","\n","Quantum computing represents a revolutionary approach to computation that could solve problems that are currently intractable for classical computers. As a computer science student, understanding the principles of quantum computing, including its potential and limitations, will be essential as this technology continues to develop and impact various fields.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Part B: Short Essay\n","prompt = \"Write a 150-word essay on the importance of clean water access worldwide.\"\n","response = gpt_request(prompt)\n","print(\"üìù Clean Water Essay:\")\n","print(response)\n","print(f\"\\nWord count: {len(response.split())}\")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"GUFaHPxGUo05","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754909210420,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4863,"user":{"displayName":"Rania","userId":"13750069140470329881"}},"outputId":"03d2e538-c60a-4614-d25f-8e6bf41eb9db"},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["üìù Clean Water Essay:\n","Clean water access is a fundamental human right and a critical component of public health, economic development, and environmental sustainability.

Additionally, it could mislead readers to think that glucose is the only product of photosynthesis.\n","  \n","- **Explanation B**: This explanation is scientifically accurate and comprehensive. It correctly identifies the chloroplasts as the site of photosynthesis and describes the processes involved in detail, including the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. It captures the complexity of photosynthesis, which is essential for an accurate understanding.\n","\n","#### 3. Appropriate Audience Level\n","- **Explanation A**: This explanation is appropriate for a younger audience or individuals with little to no scientific background. It's suitable for elementary education settings, outreach programs, or introductory science classes.\n","  \n","- **Explanation B**: This explanation is best suited for high school students, college students, or individuals with a background in biology or environmental science. It assumes a level of prior knowledge that is not accessible to everyone.\n","\n","#### 4. Completeness\n","- **Explanation A**: This explanation provides a basic overview of photosynthesis, touching on essential elements like sunlight, chlorophyll, glucose, and oxygen. However, it lacks details about the mechanisms and steps involved in the process, which limits its completeness.\n","  \n","- **Explanation B**: This explanation is much more complete, detailing the specific processes involved in photosynthesis. It explains the stages and the chemical reactions that occur, providing a thorough understanding of the topic.\n","\n","### Recommendations\n","- **For General Audiences (e.g., younger students, general public)**: **Explanation A** is the better choice. Its clarity and accessibility make it suitable for those who are new to the concept of photosynthesis and might feel overwhelmed by scientific terminology. It can serve well in introductory educational materials or public outreach initiatives.\n","\n","- **For Academic or Specialized Audiences (e.g., high school biology students, undergraduate students)**: **Explanation B** is more appropriate. Its scientific accuracy and completeness make it suitable for individuals who need a deeper understanding of the photosynthesis process. It can be used in textbooks, advanced science classes, or any setting where a more detailed explanation is required.\n","\n","### Conclusion\n","In summary, the choice between the two explanations depends greatly on the audience's background and the purpose of the communication. For clarity and accessibility, Explanation A is preferable. For scientific accuracy and completeness, Explanation B is superior.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Exercise 7: Advanced Prompt Engineering\n"],"metadata":{"id":"XbWWm8FvVHgV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754909765558,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":16,"user":{"displayName":"Rania","userId":"13750069140470329881"}}},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","# Test different temperature settings\n","prompt = \"Write a creative opening line for a mystery novel.\"\n","\n","print(\"üå°Ô∏è Temperature Comparison:\")\n","for temp in [0.1, 0.5, 0.9]:\n","    response = gpt_request(prompt, temperature=temp)\n","    print(f\"Temperature {temp}: {response}\\n\")\n","\n","# Test prompt specificity\n","vague_prompt = \"Write about AI.\"\n","specific_prompt = \"Write a 100-word explanation of how AI chatbots like GPT-4o-mini process and respond to user questions, aimed at high school students.\"\n","\n","print(\"üéØ Prompt Specificity Comparison:\")\n","print(\"Vague prompt result:\")\n","print(gpt_request(vague_prompt))\n","print(\"\\nSpecific prompt result:\")\n","print(gpt_request(specific_prompt))\n"],"metadata":{"id":"j_Fzb1arVJYh","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754909849751,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":82171,"user":{"displayName":"Rania","userId":"13750069140470329881"}},"outputId":"024aef3f-48bc-4f0f-8b77-13493d957e69"},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["üå°Ô∏è Temperature Comparison:\n","Temperature 0.1: The fog rolled in like a whispered secret, cloaking the town in shadows, but it was the sudden silence that hinted at the storm brewing beneath the surface.\n","\n","Temperature 0.5: The rain drummed a relentless tattoo against the cobblestones, but it was the sudden silence of the alley that whispered secrets of a crime yet to be uncovered.\n","\n","Temperature 0.9: The fog clung to the cobblestone streets like a secret, muffling the sound of footsteps as Eleanor stumbled upon a blood-stained envelope that whispered her name.\n","\n","üéØ Prompt Specificity Comparison:\n","Vague prompt result:\n","Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and learn like humans.
