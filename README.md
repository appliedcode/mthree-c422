## Overview
This Repo contains code related to AI/ML training 
## Working with Colab

To access and work with this repository using **Google Colab**, follow these steps:

1. **Open Google Colab**  
   Go to [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com) and sign in with your Google account.

2. **Open the Notebook**  
   - If you have Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) in this repository, you can open them directly in Colab:  
     - Click on **File > Open notebook > GitHub** tab, then enter the repository URL or username/repo to browse and open notebooks.  
     - Alternatively, use the URL pattern:  
     `https://colab.research.google.com/github/{username}/{repository}/blob/main/{notebook}.ipynb`

3. **Create a New Notebook** (optional)  
   If you want to create a new notebook and run code interactively, click **File > New notebook**.

4. **Set Runtime to GPU/TPU (Optional)**  
   For faster training or inference, you can enable hardware accelerators:  
   - Go to **Runtime > Change runtime type**  
   - Select GPU or TPU from the **Hardware accelerator** dropdown  
   - Click **Save**

5. **Install Dependencies**  
   Colab comes with many pre-installed ML libraries. For additional dependencies, install them using shell commands:  
    ```python
    !pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   or install specific libraries inline:
    ```python
    !pip install your-library-name
    ```
   
6. **Upload Data (If Needed)**  
   To upload files from your local machine:
   ```python
     from google.colab import files
     uploaded = files.upload()
   ```
   Alternatively, mount your Google Drive for larger datasets:  
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```
7. **Run the Code**  
   Use the code cells to run training, evaluation, or inference scripts as explained in the Usage section of this README.
