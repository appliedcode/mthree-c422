# Instructor Transcript: 08_transformer_models_attention.ipynb

## Learning Objectives
This session covers Transformer models and attention mechanisms, foundational to modern NLP. Participants learn about architectures, attention, and practical applications.

## Key Activities
- Understand Transformer architecture and innovations.
- Explore self-attention and multi-head attention mechanisms.
- Use pre-trained models (BERT, GPT, T5) for NLP tasks.
- Implement and fine-tune Transformer models.
- Evaluate and benchmark model performance.

## Takeaways
Participants gain a deep understanding of how Transformers work and how to apply them to a variety of NLP problems.
