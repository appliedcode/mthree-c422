# Instructor Transcript: 05_text_classification.ipynb

## Learning Objectives
This notebook covers text classification using various algorithms and evaluation techniques. Participants learn to split data, train models, and compare results.

## Key Activities
- Explore different classifiers: MultinomialNB, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest.
- Use TF-IDF and CountVectorizer for feature extraction.
- Perform train/test split and cross-validation.
- Evaluate models with confusion matrix, F1-score, and accuracy.
- Practice multi-class classification and model selection.

## Takeaways
Participants gain hands-on experience in building, evaluating, and comparing text classification models for real-world NLP tasks.
