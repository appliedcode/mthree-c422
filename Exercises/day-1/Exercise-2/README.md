# Handwritten Digit Classification with TensorFlow on Google Colab

## Problem Statement

Build and train a simple neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal is to:
1. Load and preprocess the MNIST data.
2. Define a feed-forward neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.
3. Train the model and evaluate its performance.
4. Visualize sample predictions.

This exercise demonstrates basic deep learning workflows in under 10 minutes on Google Colab.
