## Team Case Study Assignment: Ethical Analysis of Healthcare AI Disparities During the COVID-19 Pandemic in China

### Overview

Your team acts as an AI Ethics advisory panel tasked with analyzing ethical, social, and technical challenges associated with the deployment of AI systems for COVID-19 diagnosis and pandemic management across multiple Chinese provinces. Leveraging insights from the real-world case study, your goal is to critically assess how AI improved healthcare outcomes while raising concerns about equity, data privacy, misinformation, and mental health impacts on different population groups.

This assignment requires a holistic evaluation of the benefits and risks of rapid AI deployment in public health emergencies, with emphasis on ethical governance and social responsibility.

### Case Study Context

During the COVID-19 pandemic, AI tools played a pivotal role in improving early diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and resource allocation in China. However, disparities emerged related to uneven access, data privacy violations, proliferation of misinformation, and adverse mental health effects in some communities.

Your team will analyze these complex interactions, exploring AI's dual-edged impact in pandemic response, informed by:
