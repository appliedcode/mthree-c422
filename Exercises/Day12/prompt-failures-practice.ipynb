Two key components of this process are filtration and disinfection. Here's a detailed overview of each step:\n","\n","### Filtration\n","\n","Filtration is the process of removing suspended solids, sediments, and some microorganisms from water. It typically involves multiple stages:\n","\n","1. **Coagulation and Flocculation**:\n","   - **Coagulation**: Chemicals (coagulants) such as aluminum sulfate or ferric chloride are added to water. These chemicals help to destabilize particles and promote aggregation.\n","   - **Flocculation**: The water is gently stirred to encourage the formation of larger particles (flocs) that can be easily removed.\n","\n","2. **Sedimentation**:\n","   - The water is allowed to sit in a sedimentation basin where the heavier flocs settle to the bottom as sludge. This step reduces the turbidity of the water.\n","\n","3. **Filtration**:\n","   - The clarified water is then passed through various filters to remove remaining particles and microorganisms. Common filtration methods include:\n","     - **Rapid Sand Filters**: Water flows through layers of sand and gravel, which trap particles.\n","     - **Microfiltration**: Uses membranes with pore sizes typically between 0.1 to 10 micrometers to remove bacteria and larger viruses.\n","     - **Ultrafiltration**: Similar to microfiltration but with smaller pore sizes, effective for removing smaller viruses and colloidal particles.\n","     - **Reverse Osmosis**: A more advanced technique that uses a semi-permeable membrane to remove ions, molecules, and larger particles from water by applying pressure.\n","\n","### Disinfection\n","\n","After filtration, disinfection is employed to eliminate pathogens that may still be present in the water. There are several methods of disinfection:\n","\n","1. **Chlorination**:\n","   - Chlorine or chlorine compounds (like chloramines) are added to the water, effectively killing bacteria, viruses, and some protozoa. Chlorination is a widely used method due to its effectiveness and residual disinfection capability.\n","\n","2. **Ultraviolet (UV) Light**:\n","   - Water is exposed to UV light, which inactivates microorganisms by damaging their DNA. This method is effective against a wide range of pathogens and doesn’t introduce any chemicals into the water.\n","\n","3. **Ozonation**:\n","   - Ozone gas is introduced into the water, where it acts as a strong oxidant that destroys pathogens. Ozone is effective but has a short half-life, requiring immediate use after generation.\n","\n","4. **Other Methods**:\n","   - Methods such as iodine treatment or the use of hydrogen peroxide can also be employed, particularly in smaller systems or emergency situations.\n","\n","### Final Steps\n","\n","After filtration and disinfection, the purified water may undergo additional processes, such as pH adjustment or remineralization, to ensure that the water is safe, palatable, and meets regulatory standards before it is distributed to consumers.\n","\n","In summary, the water purification process involves a combination of filtration to physically remove contaminants and disinfection to eliminate harmful microorganisms, ensuring that the final water supply is safe for consumption.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Problem 2 – Avoiding Hallucinations"],"metadata":{"id":"3QLe1Rv_XOiK"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Loose prompt (likely to speculate)\n","vague = \"Tell me about the most recent discovery in black hole research.\"\n","\n","# Anchored to facts & date\n","anchored = \"\"\"Based only on confirmed scientific findings up to 2023,\n","summarize the latest known discovery about black holes.\n","If not certain, reply with: \"I don't know.\"\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","print(\"--- Vague ---\")\n","print(get_ai_response(vague), \"\\n\")\n","\n","print(\"--- Anchored ---\")\n","print(get_ai_response(anchored))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"AOxUx6b3XNfA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754986791105,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":7217,"user":{"displayName":"Rania","userId":"13750069140470329881"}},"outputId":"5c7dc8f9-c854-41c2-bc71-09719c1c8670"},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["--- Vague ---\n","As of my last update in October 2023, one of the significant recent discoveries in black hole research involved the detection of gravitational waves from black hole mergers, particularly from a series of detections made by the LIGO and Virgo observatories.

Instead, the 1940s and 1950s see a greater emphasis on civilian technology and industrial development. The space race begins earlier, fueled by competition between the United States and the Soviet Union, but it takes a different form, focusing on space exploration as a symbol of national pride rather than military dominance. By the late 1960s, humans land on the Moon, but it is as part of an international collaborative project rather than a race. This technological revolution spurs a cultural renaissance, with art, music, and literature thriving in a more peaceful world.\n","\n","### Scenario 3: The Economic Boom of the 1940s\n","\n","With no World War II to disrupt economies, the 1940s see a massive economic boom in many countries. The USA, benefiting from its industrial capacity and absence of wartime destruction, becomes a global economic powerhouse. Europe, while recovering from the Great Depression, invests heavily in infrastructure and social welfare programs, leading to a more equitable society. The absence of war fosters a climate of innovation and entrepreneurship, giving rise to a diverse array of new businesses and technologies. However, as countries grow economically, issues of imperialism and colonialism begin to resurface, leading to a different kind of struggle for independence in various parts of the world, particularly in Africa and Asia, as nations demand self-determination and the end of colonial rule.\n","\n","These scenarios explore the complex changes in politics, technology, and society in a world where World War II never took place, highlighting how different historical trajectories can lead to unique outcomes.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Problem 5 – Meta-Prompting to Clarify Requirements"],"metadata":{"id":"YrmHg5F-XazT"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Ambiguous\n","ambiguous = \"Create an efficient search algorithm.\"\n","\n","# Meta-prompt\n","meta = \"\"\"Before writing any code, explain what 'efficient search algorithm' could mean in this context.\n","List possible interpretations and complexities.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:\n","\n","1. **Refraction**: When sunlight enters a raindrop, it slows down and bends due to the change in medium from air to water. This bending of light is called refraction.\n","\n","2. **Dispersion**: As the light refracts, it also disperses into its component colors because different wavelengths of light bend at slightly different angles. This is what separates white light into the spectrum of colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.\n","\n","3. **Reflection**: After dispersion, the light reflects off the inside surface of the raindrop. This reflection causes the light to travel back toward the front of the droplet.\n","\n","4. **Refraction Again**: As the light exits the raindrop, it refracts again. This second refraction further separates the colors and causes them to spread out even more.\n","\n","5. **Viewing Angle**: To see a rainbow, an observer must be positioned with their back to the sun and facing the rain. The light refracted and reflected from the raindrops will create a circular arc of colors in the sky.\n","\n","The primary rainbow, which is the most commonly seen, typically has red on the outer edge and violet on the inner edge. Sometimes, a secondary rainbow can also appear outside the primary rainbow, which is fainter and has the order of colors reversed, due to an additional reflection inside the raindrop.\n","\n","Overall, the formation of a rainbow is a beautiful interplay of light and water, creating one of nature's most vibrant displays. \n","\n","> Name 10 popular programming languages.\n","Here are 10 popular programming languages:\n","\n","1.
