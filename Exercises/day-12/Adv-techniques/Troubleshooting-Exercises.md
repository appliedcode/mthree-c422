# Live Class Discussion Scenarios

## Scenario 1: The Unfocused Customer Query

Your AI chatbot for an online education platform frequently responds with generic, unhelpful answers whenever students ask technical questions. During a live demo, a student types:
“I can’t get my Python code to run and have an assignment due tomorrow.”
The bot replies:
“Programming can be tricky. Keep trying and read some tutorials.”

Discussion Points:

- What key context is missing from the prompt?
- How would you restructure the prompt to guide the AI toward specific, actionable troubleshooting steps?
- Which details about the student’s environment and error messages would you include?
- How might you set constraints or examples to ensure clear, useful responses?

## Scenario 2: The Brand Voice Mismatch

Your marketing team deployed an AI to generate social media captions for a luxury skincare brand. They receive this prompt:
“Write an Instagram caption that makes people want to buy our products.”
The AI posts:
“Get flawless skin now! Best beauty product ever! \#musthave \#skincare”

Discussion Points:

- Which aspects of the brand voice and audience profile are absent from the prompt?
- What contextual details and tone guidelines would you add to align with a luxury market?
- How could you incorporate specific product benefits or brand heritage into the prompt?
- What structural elements or examples would help the AI produce an elegant, high-end caption?
