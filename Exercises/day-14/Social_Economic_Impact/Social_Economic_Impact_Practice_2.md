## **Problem Statement: AI in Traffic Management and Road Safety**

You are part of a **smart city traffic analytics team** tasked with using **AI-powered traffic sensors** to improve traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance road safety across multiple districts. The city has deployed sensors that track vehicle counts, average speeds, and accident alerts in real time.

While these technologies can significantly improve transportation efficiency, they also raise **ethical and social concerns** â€” including surveillance risks from vehicle tracking, algorithmic bias in congestion management (which may favor certain districts), and public trust in automated traffic decisions.

You must **analyze a dataset** of synthetic traffic sensor readings, identify problem areas, evaluate ethical issues, gauge public trust in AI-managed traffic systems, and recommend both **technical improvements and governance policies**.

### **Dataset Loading Code (Colab-Ready)**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)
n = 500

# Sample city districts and conditions
districts = ["Downtown", "Suburban", "Industrial Zone", "Residential Area"]
trust_levels = ["High", "Medium", "Low"]

# Create synthetic traffic monitoring dataset
data_traffic = pd.DataFrame({
    "Sensor_ID": range(1, n + 1),
    "District": np.random.choice(districts, n, p=[0.35, 0.3, 0.2, 0.15]),
    "Vehicle_Count": np.random.randint(50, 1000, n),         # vehicles per hour
    "Average_Speed": np.round(np.random.uniform(10, 70, n), 1), # km/h
    "Accident_Alert": np.random.choice([0, 1], n, p=[0.9, 0.1]),
    "Public_Trust_in_AI": np.random.choice(trust_levels, n, p=[0.4, 0.4, 0.2])
})

# Categorize congestion levels based on vehicle counts
bins = [0, 200, 500, 800, 1000]
labels = ["Low", "Moderate", "High", "Severe"]
data_traffic["Congestion_Level"] = pd.cut(data_traffic["Vehicle_Count"], bins=bins, labels=labels)

# Show sample data
print(data_traffic.head())
```

### **Part 1: AI in Traffic Monitoring and Resource Management**

**Goal:**
Analyze traffic sensor data to identify congestion and safety issues across districts, helping optimize traffic signal control and emergency response.

**Objectives:**

- Determine districts with highest congestion and accident alerts.
- Visualize vehicle counts and average speeds by district.
- Discuss how AI could dynamically adjust traffic signals or reroute vehicles to improve flow.

***

### **Part 2: Ethical Challenges in AI Traffic Systems**

**Goal:**
Identify and evaluate ethical concerns in AI-powered traffic management.

**Objectives:**

- Discuss data privacy risks (e.g., tracking patterns revealing personal movement).
- Examine risks of algorithmic bias when prioritizing traffic improvements in certain communities.
- Propose fairness and transparency measures for AI traffic algorithms.

***

### **Part 3: Public Trust and Perception of AI in Traffic Context**

**Goal:**
Assess and improve societal trust in AI-based traffic control systems.

**Objectives:**

- Analyze public trust data for AI traffic management.
- Suggest strategies (public dashboards, explainable alerts, open data) to build trust.
- Identify community engagement practices to align AI traffic solutions with citizen needs.

***

**Overall Deliverable:**
Using the **traffic monitoring dataset**, provide:

- Visual analytics of congestion, speed, and accidents
- Ethical risk assessment and mitigation ideas
- Recommendations for increasing public trust and fairness in AI-driven traffic management
