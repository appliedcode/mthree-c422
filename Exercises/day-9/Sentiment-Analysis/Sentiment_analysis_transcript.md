## Learning Objectives
This session explores both rule-based and ML-based sentiment analysis. Participants apply VADER and logistic regression, handle negation, and visualize sentiment distributions.

## Key Activities
- Use VADER for rule-based sentiment scoring and classification.
- Train a logistic regression model with TF-IDF features for sentiment prediction.
- Analyze the impact of negation and context on sentiment.
- Visualize both predicted and true sentiment distributions.

## Takeaways
Participants learn to compare rule-based and ML-based approaches, understand the challenges of sentiment analysis, and interpret results using visualizations.
