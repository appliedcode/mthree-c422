In 1911, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of radium and polonium.\n","\n","3. **Contribution to Medicine**: Curie's research laid the foundation for the use of radioactive isotopes in medical treatments, particularly in cancer therapy. She established mobile radiography units during World War I to help treat wounded soldiers.\n","\n","4. **Legacy**: Marie Curie's work has had a lasting impact on science and medicine. She is often celebrated as a trailblazer for women in science, breaking barriers in a male-dominated field. Her dedication to research and her pioneering spirit continue to inspire generations.\n","\n","Marie Curie passed away on July 4, 1934, from aplastic anemia, a condition believed to be caused by prolonged exposure to radiation.
