üìä Session 6: Text Classification

Learning Objectives:

    Understand different text classification algorithms (MultinomialNB, SVM, Logistic Regression)
    Implement train/test split and cross-validation
    Evaluate models using confusion matrix, F1-score, and other metrics
    Practice multi-class text classification
    Compare model performance and select the best approach

Dataset: We'll work with news articles, product reviews, and custom datasets
