## NLP Assignment: Multi-Class Text Classification using Transformers on the 20 Newsgroups Dataset

### Problem Statement:

In this assignment, you will explore Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques by performing multi-class text classification on the widely-used **20 Newsgroups** dataset. This dataset contains approximately 20,000 newsgroup posts categorized into 20 different topics such as politics, religion, sports, and technology.

Your task is to preprocess the raw text data, tokenize it for Transformer input, fine-tune a pretrained Transformer model (e.g., BERT) to classify texts into one of the 20 categories, and evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate metrics. This exercise will deepen your understanding of Transformer architectures applied to real-world text classification problems and multi-class learning challenges.

### Dataset Details:

- **20 Newsgroups dataset:**
    - Contains roughly 20,000 posts collected from 20 different newsgroups.
    - Each post is labeled with one of 20 topic categories, including but not limited to:
        - Politics
        - Religion
        - Sports
        - Science/Technology
    - The dataset is balanced and commonly used for benchmarking text classification algorithms.


### Task Objectives:

1. **Load and Preprocess the Dataset:**
    - Load the 20 Newsgroups dataset using libraries such as `sklearn.datasets` or Huggingface’s `datasets`.
    - Optionally clean the text (removing headers, footers, quotes, special characters).
    - Tokenize the dataset using a pretrained Transformer tokenizer (e.g., `BertTokenizer`) with padding and truncation set to a fixed maximum sequence length (e.g., 128 tokens).
2. **Model Fine-Tuning:**
    - Load a pretrained Transformer model suitable for sequence classification (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`) and modify the classification head for 20 output classes (i.e., `num_labels=20`).
    - Fine-tune the model on the training portion of the dataset.
3. **Evaluation:**
    - Evaluate model performance on the test dataset using multi-class classification metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for each class and overall weighted averages.
    - Generate and analyze a confusion matrix to observe classification errors among categories.
4. **Optional Extension:**
    - Briefly discuss and optionally demonstrate audio feature extraction techniques (such as MFCCs) and how such approaches relate to emotion or sentiment recognition from speech signals, expanding your perspective to multimodal NLP tasks.

### Hints and Guidance:

- Leverage `sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` or Huggingface’s `datasets` for easy access to the dataset.
- Use `BertTokenizer` from Huggingface `transformers` for tokenization, ensuring inputs are padded and truncated to consistent lengths.
- Use the `Trainer` API from Huggingface for simplified training and evaluation workflows.
- Configure training parameters carefully: a batch size around 8-16, 2-3 epochs, and an appropriate learning rate can help balance speed and accuracy.
- Use functions from `sklearn.metrics` or Huggingface’s built-in compute_metrics utilities for calculating evaluation metrics and confusion matrices.
- Consider analyzing misclassified cases for deeper insights.
