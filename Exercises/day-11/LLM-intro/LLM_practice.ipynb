        "\n",
        "- Write a prompt asking an AI to explain how photosynthesis works.\n",
        "- Try two versions:\n",
        "a) Give a brief explanation in 3 sentences.\n",
        "b) Give a detailed explanation with examples, formatted in bullet points.\n",
        "- Compare the length, clarity, and completeness of the outputs.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Exercise 2: Few-Shot Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "- Create a few-shot prompt that shows how to politely decline an invitation in English and French.\n",
        "- Provide 2 examples (English phrase + French translation).\n",
        "- Add a new English phrase and ask the model to provide the French translation.\n",
        "- Experiment by changing the number of examples and observe changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "***\n",
        "\n",
        "### Exercise 3: Persona Roleplay\n",

        "- Write a prompt instructing the model to behave as a friendly travel guide for Tokyo.\n",
        "- Ask for recommendations on places to visit and food to try.\n",

        "### Exercise 7: Controlling Output Length and Style\n",
        "\n",
        "- Ask the model to describe ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence‚Äù in:\n",
        "a) a tweet (280 characters max)\n",
        "b) a formal academic abstract (~150 words)\n",
        "c) a children‚Äôs story (simple language)\n",

        "\n",
        "### Exercise 8: Multi-turn Conversation Simulation\n",
        "\n",
        "- Simulate a customer support dialogue where the AI asks clarifying questions before providing a solution to a printer issue.\n",
        "- Write prompt instructions to make the AI confirm your answers before continuing.\n",
        "- Try chaining multiple prompts and see how memory of conversation context influences coherence.\n",

        "### Reflection Questions for Self-Review\n",
        "\n",
        "- Which prompts resulted in the most relevant and coherent answers?\n",
        "- How did instructions and personas influence tone and style?\n",
        "- Did few-shot examples improve output quality or consistency?\n",
        "- How effective was the menu/command syntax in structuring the response?\n",
        "- How did controlling verbosity and formatting shape the clarity of information?\n",
