        "# Problem Statement: Audio Classification with Transformers on the ESC-50 Environmental Sound Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "This is from the file Exercises/day-10/Problem_Statement_Audio.md\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "Build and evaluate a transformer-based audio classification model using the ESC-50 dataset. The task involves loading and preprocessing environmental audio clips, applying a pretrained transformer or fine-tuning it for classifying audio into 50 environmental sound classes, and analyzing model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "**ESC-50** (Environmental Sound Classification)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Publicly available dataset of 2,000 labeled environmental audio recordings (5 seconds each) across 50 classes such as dog bark, rain, siren, and keyboard typing.\n",
        "- Download URL: https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50 (direct audio files in WAV format and metadata CSV)\n",
        "- The dataset is well suited for benchmarking environmental audio classification models.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Learning Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "- Load and preprocess short environmental audio clips (sample rate standardization, normalization).\n",
        "- Extract audio features suitable for transformer models (raw waveform or learned embeddings).\n",
        "- Use a pretrained audio transformer model (e.g., Wav2Vec 2.0, Hubert) as a feature extractor or fine-tune it for classification.\n",
        "- Train, validate, and test the model on the ESC-50 dataset classes.\n",
        "- Visualize training progress and assess model accuracy, confusion matrices, and class-wise performance.\n",
        "- Investigate the attention patterns of the transformer to understand which audio segments influence classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Tasks\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Dataset Preparation**\n",
        "    - Download and unzip ESC-50.\n",
        "    - Load metadata CSV to map audio file names to labels.\n",
        "    - Implement audio loading pipeline (e.g., using librosa or torchaudio) to read and preprocess the clips uniformly.\n",
        "2. **Feature Extraction and Modeling**\n",
        "    - Use pretrained transformer audio models (e.g., `facebook/wav2vec2-base`, `superb/hubert-large-superb-ks`) from Hugging Face Transformers.\n",
        "    - Convert audio clips into model inputs (waveform arrays or processed features).\n",
        "    - Fine-tune on ESC-50 or extract fixed embeddings and train a classifier head.\n",
        "3. **Training and Evaluation**\n",
        "    - Split data into training and testing sets as per standard ESC-50 folds or create your own split.\n",
        "    - Train the model and monitor learning curves.\n",
        "    - Evaluate accuracy, per-class precision \\& recall, and generate confusion matrix.\n",
        "4. **Attention Visualization and Analysis (Optional)**\n",
        "    - Visualize attention maps or gradients to interpret model focus on specific temporal audio segments.\n",
        "    - Analyze attention differences across sound classes.\n",
        "5. **Reporting**\n",
        "    - Summarize data preprocessing challenges and solutions.\n",
        "    - Present quantitative model results and qualitative insights from attention visualizations.\n",
        "    - Discuss potential improvements like data augmentation or ensembling.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Deliverables\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python notebook or script implementing data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.\n",
        "- Visualizations of attention weights and model performance metrics.\n",
        "- A brief report or markdown summarizing findings, challenges, and future directions.\n",
        "\n",
        "This problem encourages hands-on experience with transformer models for audio classification on a real, publicly available dataset, expanding beyond speech recognition to environmental sound understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you'd like, I can also help generate starter code or a complete Colab notebook for this task! Would you be interested?"
