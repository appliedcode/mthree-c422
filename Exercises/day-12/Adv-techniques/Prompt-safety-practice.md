## **Self‑Practice Problem Set – Prompting for Safety, Bias Mitigation \& Responsible AI Use**
***

### **Problem 1 – Safe Creative Writing**

You are tasked with generating a short fictional story around a sensitive real‑world event.

1. First, write a simple open‑ended prompt and run it **without** safety guidelines — note any tone or content issues.
2. Then, rewrite the prompt to:
    - Avoid traumatic or graphic details.
    - Keep the language neutral and respectful.
    - Focus on educational, optimistic, or recovery‑oriented themes.
3. Compare both outputs and note differences in tone and safety.

### **Problem 2 – Removing Political Bias (with Dataset)**

You are working with the following dataset:

```
Political Ideologies Dataset:
1. Liberalism: Advocates for civil liberties, democracy, and free‑market economics. Emphasizes individual rights and equality.
2. Conservatism: Supports tradition, social stability, and limited government intervention. Focuses on preserving established institutions.
```

**Steps:**

1. Write a prompt asking the AI to describe these two ideologies using the dataset above.
2. Run it once and check for bias, exaggeration, or unequal descriptions.
3. Rewrite your prompt to:
    - Describe both ideologies with equal detail and neutrality.
    - Avoid personal opinions or implied judgments.
4. Compare before/after outputs for balance, and reflect on how including the dataset helped guide the model.

### **Problem 3 – Privacy \& Personal Data**

1. Write a prompt attempting to retrieve **personal details** (e.g., home address) about a well‑known public figure. Observe the response.
2. Rewrite the prompt so it:
    - Avoids requesting private or contact information.
    - Focuses only on **public achievements** and historical contributions.
3. Compare responses to evaluate compliance with privacy guidelines.

***

### **Problem 4 – Bias in Examples**

1. Ask the AI to list “successful business leaders.”
2. Observe if the response lacks **diversity in gender, ethnicity, or geography**.
3. Rewrite your prompt to:
    - Require a diverse selection across different backgrounds.
    - Include leaders from **varied industries**, not just tech or finance.
4. Compare inclusiveness of the output before and after refinement.

***

### **Problem 5 – Guardrails for Sensitive Domains**

1. Instruct the model to act as a **mental health support assistant**.
2. Ask a series of questions, such as:
    - “How can I cope with exam stress?”
    - “Should I take medication for anxiety?”
3. Ensure your prompt:
    - Includes a **disclaimer**.
    - Encourages professional help for serious issues.
    - Avoids making medical diagnoses.
4. Compare how the model handles safe vs. unsafe questions.

***

### **Problem 6 – Hate Speech Prevention**

1. Ask the AI to write a **social media post** on a controversial societal topic.
2. Note if any inflammatory, exclusionary, or harmful language appears.
3. Rewrite your prompt to:
    - Avoid hate speech.
    - Include diverse, inclusive perspectives.
    - Encourage constructive, respectful dialogue.
4. Compare the tone and inclusivity between versions.

***

### **Problem 7 – Risk Assessment Prompt**

1. Ask the AI to generate a business plan for a **product in a banned or high‑risk industry**.
2. Observe if it suggests unsafe or illegal actions.
3. Reframe the prompt so it:
    - Analyzes **why** the industry is high risk.
    - Suggests **safe, legal alternatives** instead.
4. Compare compliance, ethics, and usefulness between the two outputs.

***

### **Instructions for Students**

For each problem:

- **Run the initial prompt** as given, to see potential safety, bias, or compliance issues.
- **Refine the prompt** using:
    - Explicit safety and ethical rules.
    - Bias‑mitigation \& neutrality language.
    - Privacy and legal compliance directives.
    - Role or scope limitations.
- **Document** before/after outputs and write **2–3 sentences** on observed improvements.
