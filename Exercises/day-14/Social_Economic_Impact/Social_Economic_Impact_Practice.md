### Dataset Loading Code (Colab-Ready)

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Set random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(123)
n = 400

# Define possible district types and pollution levels
districts = ["Industrial Area", "Residential Area", "Parkland", "Commercial Zone"]
pollution_levels = ["Low", "Moderate", "High", "Critical"]

# Generate synthetic environmental sensor data
data_env = pd.DataFrame({
    "Sensor_ID": range(1, n + 1),
    "District": np.random.choice(districts, n, p=[0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2]),
    "Air_Quality_Index": np.random.randint(20, 300, n),
    "Water_Contamination_Level": np.random.randint(1, 10, n),
    "AI_Pollution_Alert": np.random.choice([0, 1], n, p=[0.8, 0.2]),
    "Public_Trust_in_AI": np.random.choice(["High", "Medium", "Low"], n, p=[0.3, 0.5, 0.2])
})

# Categorize Air Quality Index into pollution levels for easier interpretation
bins = [0, 50, 100, 150, 300]
labels = pollution_levels
data_env["Air_Quality_Category"] = pd.cut(data_env["Air_Quality_Index"], bins=bins, labels=labels)

# Display sample data
print(data_env.head())
```

### Part 1: AI in Environmental Monitoring and Resource Management

**Goal:**
Analyze environmental sensor data to identify pollution patterns across different districts. Use the data to support effective deployment of resources and interventions aimed at improving air and water quality.

**Objectives:**

- Examine distribution of pollution levels across districts using air and water quality metrics.
- Understand the spatial variability of environmental risks through data visualization.
- Discuss how AI and sensor networks can enhance real-time monitoring and decision-making.

***

### Part 2: Ethical Challenges in Environmental AI Deployment

**Goal:**
Identify and evaluate key ethical concerns that arise in the deployment of AI for environmental monitoring.

**Objectives:**

- Explore data privacy risks related to citizen-linked environmental data.
- Understand challenges of algorithmic transparency in AI pollution alerts and decision-making.
- Recognize biases resulting from uneven sensor distribution and its consequences on environmental justice.
- Propose ethical guidelines, governance policies, or technical solutions to address these challenges.

***

### Part 3: Public Trust and Perception of AI in Environmental Context

**Goal:**
Assess public trust and perception concerning AI-driven environmental monitoring systems and identify factors influencing trust.

**Objectives:**

- Analyze survey or simulated data reflecting public trust levels in AI-based pollution alerts.
- Interpret the distribution of trust levels and potential societal concerns.
- Discuss how factors like transparency, communication, and community engagement affect acceptance of AI technologies.
- Suggest practical strategies to foster and maintain public trust in environmental AI systems.
