            "The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century, encompasses two interrelated theories: special relativity (1905) and general relativity (1915). Special relativity revolutionized our understanding of space and time, introducing concepts such as the constancy of the speed of light and time dilation, exemplified by the twin paradox where a traveling twin ages more slowly than one who remains on Earth. General relativity expanded this framework to include gravity, describing it not as a force but as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass, successfully predicting phenomena such as the bending of light around massive objects, which was confirmed during a solar eclipse in 1919. Historically, this theory marked a significant shift from Newtonian physics, reshaping our understanding of the universe and laying the groundwork for modern cosmology and astrophysics. Its significance is profound, influencing technologies such as GPS and leading to insights about black holes and the expanding universe. However, common misconceptions persist, such as the idea that relativity is only about speed or that it denies the existence of absolute time, whereas it actually reveals that time is relative and intertwined with the spatial dimension, leading to a more intricate understanding of our universe. \n",

            "--- Smaller Prompt 1 ---\n",
            "The theory of special relativity, developed by Albert Einstein in 1905, fundamentally changed our understanding of space and time. Here are the key ideas explained in simple terms:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Speed of Light is Constant**: One of the main principles of special relativity is that the speed of light in a vacuum is always the same, no matter how fast you are moving or in which direction. This speed is about 299,792 kilometers per second (or about 186,282 miles per second).\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Relative Motion**: Special relativity shows that measurements of time and space can differ depending on how fast you are moving relative to someone else. For example, if you are traveling very fast, time will pass more slowly for you compared to someone who is stationary. This phenomenon is known as time dilation.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Length Contraction**: Similarly, objects moving at high speeds will appear shorter in the direction of motion to a stationary observer. This is called length contraction.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Mass and Energy Relationship**: Special relativity also introduces the famous equation \\(E=mc^2\\), which means that mass can be converted into energy and vice versa. This equation shows that even a small amount of mass can be turned into a large amount of energy because of the \\(c^2\\) (the speed of light squared) factor.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **No Absolute Reference Frame**: In special relativity, there is no absolute frame of reference. This means that all motion is relative. If two people are moving relative to each other, they can each consider themselves to be at rest, and there is no \"preferred\" perspective.\n",
            "\n",
            "To summarize, special relativity tells us that space and time are interwoven and that our observations of them can change based on our relative speeds. It challenges our everyday understanding of how the universe works and has been confirmed by many experiments since its introduction. \n",

            "The theory of general relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915, fundamentally changed our understanding of gravity. Unlike Newton's view of gravity as a force acting at a distance, general relativity describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Key Concepts of General Relativity:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Spacetime**: In general relativity, time and three-dimensional space are intertwined into a four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. Massive objects like planets and stars warp this spacetime around them.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Curvature of Spacetime**: According to general relativity, massive objects (like the Earth or the Sun) cause a curvature in the fabric of spacetime. Smaller objects move along the curves in this spacetime, which we perceive as gravitational attraction.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Geodesics**: Objects in free fall move along paths called geodesics, which are the shortest paths in curved spacetime. This means that objects naturally follow the curvature created by mass rather than being \"pulled\" by a force.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Real-World Example: The Orbit of Mercury\n",
            "\n",
            "One of the most famous real-world confirmations of general relativity is the precession of the orbit of Mercury. For many years, astronomers noticed that Mercury's elliptical orbit around the Sun did not perfectly match the predictions made using Newtonian mechanics. Specifically, the point of Mercury's closest approach to the Sun (called perihelion) shifted slightly with each orbit.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Newton's Prediction:\n",
            "Using Newton's laws, astronomers calculated the orbit of Mercury and found that it should precess (shift) by a certain amount. However, observations showed that Mercury's orbit precessed more than Newton's calculations could account for—about 574 arcseconds per century.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### General Relativity's Prediction:\n",
            "Einstein's theory of general relativity provided a new way to calculate gravitational effects. When applying general relativity to Mercury's orbit, Einstein accounted for the curvature of spacetime caused by the immense mass of the Sun. His calculations showed that the additional precession of Mercury's orbit could be explained by this curvature.\n",
            "\n",
            "The result? General relativity predicted an extra precession of about 43 arcseconds per century, perfectly matching the discrepancy observed. This was one of the first major tests of general relativity and provided strong evidence that the theory accurately described gravitational phenomena.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Conclusion\n",
            "\n",
            "General relativity revolutionized our understanding of gravity, providing a framework that explains not just the movement of planets, but a wide range of phenomena, from the bending of light around massive objects (gravitational lensing) to the expansion of the universe itself. Mercury's orbit serves as a classic example of how general relativity differs from Newtonian mechanics and demonstrates its profound implications for our understanding of the cosmos. \n",

            "Certainly! Here are some common misconceptions about Einstein's theory of relativity:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Time Dilation Means Time Slows Down for Everyone**: Many people think that time dilation means that time itself slows down universally. In reality, time dilation is relative; it depends on the observer's frame of reference. For example, an observer moving at high speed will see time slow down for another observer, but they won't perceive their own time as slowed.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Nothing Can Move Faster Than Light**: While it's true that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum, some misunderstand this to mean that information cannot be transmitted faster than light. Certain phenomena, like quantum entanglement, can appear to transmit information instantaneously, but they do not allow for faster-than-light communication.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Massive Objects Create Gravity by Curving Space**: While it's true that massive objects cause spacetime to curve, some people think that the curvature itself is what causes gravity. In reality, gravity is the result of the influence of that curvature on the motion of objects.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Relativity is Just a Theory**: Some mistakenly equate \"theory\" with \"guess\" or \"hypothesis.\" In scientific terms, a theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, supported by a body of evidence. Relativity is one of the most tested theories in physics.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Time Travel is Possible**: While relativity allows for certain scenarios that could theoretically permit time travel (like wormholes), it does not provide a practical method for time travel that is achievable with our current understanding of physics.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Relativity is Only About Speed**: While special relativity primarily deals with the effects of high speeds, general relativity deals with gravitation and the curvature of spacetime. These are distinct but interconnected aspects of the same theory.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **GPS Doesn't Need to Account for Relativity**: Many believe that GPS technology is straightforward and does not involve relativistic effects. In reality, satellites experience both special and general relativistic time dilation effects, and these must be corrected for accurate positioning.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Einstein Said Everything is Relative**: While relativity emphasizes the relativity of measurements (like time and space), it does not imply that \"everything is relative.\" Physical laws are consistent and universal; it's the measurements that can vary based on the observer's frame of reference.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **Black Holes are Just a Theory**: Some people think that black holes are merely theoretical constructs. While they are predicted by general relativity, observational evidence (like the Event Horizon Telescope imaging the black hole in M87) supports their existence.\n",
            "\n",
            "10. **Relativity is Incompatible with Quantum Mechanics**: While general relativity and quantum mechanics describe different aspects of the universe, they are not fundamentally incompatible. Physicists are actively working toward a theory of quantum gravity that reconciles the two.\n",

            "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
            "1. **Function `merge_sort`**: This is the main function that handles the sorting. It first checks if the array has one or fewer elements (base case) and returns it as it is already sorted.\n",
            "  \n",
            "2. **Dividing the Array**: The array is divided into two halves using the middle index.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Recursive Calls**: The function calls itself recursively on both halves to sort them.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Function `merge`**: This function takes two sorted arrays (left and right) and merges them into a single sorted array. It uses two pointers to track the current index in each array.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Merging Process**: The merging process involves comparing the elements pointed by the two pointers and adding the smaller element to the merged array. This continues until all elements from both arrays are processed.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Adding Remaining Elements**: After one of the arrays is fully traversed, any remaining elements from the other array are appended to the merged array.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Time Complexity:\n",
            "- The time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n) because:\n",
            "  - The array is divided in half log(n) times (where n is the number of elements).\n",
            "  - Each level of division requires O(n) time to merge the elements back together. Thus, the overall complexity is O(n log n).\n"
