        "\n",
        "1. **Fundamentals**\n",
        "    - Create direct and zero-shot/few-shot prompts explaining healthcare concepts.\n",
        "    - Use clear instructions and test on dataset entries.\n",
        "2. **Intermediate Techniques**\n",
        "    - Chain-of-thought prompts breaking down causes and treatments per disease type.\n",
        "    - Persona-based prompts (e.g., doctor, health educator) explaining complex info simply.\n",
        "3. **Advanced**\n",
        "    - Multi-turn conversation simulating a patient-doctor Q\\&A, maintaining context.\n",
        "    - Resolve ambiguity in vague medical prompts by refining with dataset facts.\n",
        "    - Domain-specific prompts for summarizing research, recommending wellness habits, extracting JSON structured data on diseases or treatments.\n",
        "4. **Safety \\& Ethics**\n",
        "    - Write prompts avoiding medical misinformation and biased language.\n",
        "    - Add instructions preventing unsafe advice.\n",
        "    - Include disclaimers and privacy respect.\n",
        "5. **Integration \\& Version Control**\n",
        "    - Implement prompt versioning with at least three phrasings for explaining public health.\n",
        "    - Construct multi-stage pipelines (e.g., disease summary ‚Üí suggested lifestyle changes).\n",
        "6. **Monitoring \\& Evaluation**\n",
        "    - Log prompts, latencies, and response excerpts.\n",
        "    - Perform keyword relevance checks (e.g., ‚Äútreatment‚Äù, ‚Äúrisk‚Äù, ‚Äúprevention‚Äù).\n",
        "    - Calculate consistency scores over repeated prompt runs.\n",
        "7. **Security \\& Privacy**\n",
        "    - Simulate refusal of private patient info requests.\n",
        "    - Demonstrate safe prompt reframing and role restriction.\n",
