            "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Function Definition**: The function `bubble_sort` takes a list of integers `arr` as input.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Length Calculation**: The variable `n` stores the length of the input list.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `n` times. Each iteration represents one full pass through the list.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Swapped Flag**: A boolean variable `swapped` is initialized to `False` at the beginning of each pass. This is used to track whether any swaps occur during that pass.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop runs from the beginning of the list to `n - i - 1`. The `-i` accounts for the fact that with each complete pass, the largest elements \"bubble up\" to their correct positions at the end of the list, so we can skip checking them in subsequent passes.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Comparison and Swap**: Inside the inner loop, we compare each element with the next one. If the current element is greater than the next element, we swap them and set the `swapped` flag to `True`.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Early Exit**: After the inner loop, if no swaps occurred (i.e., the `swapped` flag remains `False`), it means the list is already sorted, so we can break out of the outer loop early.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Return the Sorted List**: Finally, the sorted list is returned.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Example Usage:\n",
            "You can use the function as follows:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n",
