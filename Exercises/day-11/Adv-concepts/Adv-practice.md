## 📝 **Advanced Prompt Engineering Practice Lab** – Problem Statement

**Objective:**
Individually explore and apply four advanced prompt engineering techniques with GPT‑4o‑mini (or similar).
Learn how prompt design choices can make AI outputs more accurate, creative, well‑structured, and aligned with intended style.

**Techniques to Practice:**

1. **Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting** – guide the AI to reason step‑by‑step before giving an answer.
2. **Persona‑Based Prompting** – instruct the AI to take on a specific role or personality.
3. **Controlling Verbosity, Style \& Tone** – control length, detail, and formality level of the response.
4. **Prompting for Creativity vs. Accuracy** – balance imaginative vs. factual outputs via temperature and wording.

### **Tasks for Students**

#### 1️⃣ Chain‑of‑Thought Prompting

**Dataset/Scenario:**
You have a set of 2 math or logic word problems: one about calculating travel time, and one about figuring out a discount price.

- Write a **basic prompt** asking the model to solve without guidance.
- Write another prompt that clearly asks the model to **“think step by step”** and show reasoning before the answer.
- Compare outputs: Did step‑by‑step change the clarity or correctness?

***

#### 2️⃣ Persona‑Based Prompting

**Scenario:**
Imagine you run a tourism blog and need tips for 3 days in a city.

- Prompt the model **once without a persona**.
- Prompt it again asking it to respond **as a professional tour guide with 10+ years of experience**.
- Compare: How did the role affect tone, detail, and recommendations?

***

#### 3️⃣ Controlling Verbosity, Style \& Tone

**Scenario:**
Topic: “Why renewable energy matters.”

- First, get a **concise \& formal** explanation in exactly **2 sentences**.
- Then, get a **detailed \& friendly** explanation that feels like a casual blog post.
- Compare length, choice of words, and structure.

***

#### 4️⃣ Prompting for Creativity vs. Accuracy

**Scenario:**
Topic: Future transportation in 2050.

- Create a **creative** prompt (higher temperature, imaginative wording) to get a vivid story‑like description.
- Create an **accurate** prompt (lower temperature, request for factual trends) to get a realistic, data‑driven answer.
- Compare imagination, novelty, and factual grounding.

***

### **Deliverables:**

For each technique:

- Both prompts you wrote.
- The AI outputs.
- A short observation (2–3 sentences) about the differences and which prompt worked better for the intended goal.

***

### **Goal:**

By completing this lab, you should be able to **intentionally influence** an AI model’s reasoning process, tone, detail level, and creativity through advanced prompt engineering.
