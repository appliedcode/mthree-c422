            "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the branch of computer science dedicated to the creation of systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks encompass a range of functions, including problem-solving, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. AI systems can be categorized into two primary types: narrow AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks, and general AI, which aims to replicate human cognitive abilities across diverse domains. The underlying technologies of AI include machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks, enabling systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time. The growing prevalence of AI in various sectors—such as healthcare, finance, and transportation—has spurred both excitement about its potential benefits and concerns regarding ethical implications, bias, and job displacement. Future research in AI focuses on enhancing its capabilities, ensuring ethical use, and exploring its integration with human systems to create more efficient and equitable outcomes.\n"
