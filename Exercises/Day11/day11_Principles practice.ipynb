It exists in various forms, including kinetic energy (the energy of motion), potential energy (stored energy based on position), thermal energy (related to temperature), chemical energy (stored in chemical bonds), and nuclear energy (released during nuclear reactions).\n","\n","### Forms of Energy\n","\n","1. **Kinetic Energy**: This is the energy of moving objects. The kinetic energy of an object depends on its mass and velocity and is calculated using the formula: \n","   \\[\n","   KE = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2\n","   \\]\n","   where \\( m \\) is the mass and \\( v \\) is the velocity.\n","\n","2. **Potential Energy**: This energy is stored due to an object's position or state. For example, gravitational potential energy is related to an object's height above the ground and is calculated using:\n","   \\[\n","   PE = mgh\n","   \\]\n","   where \\( m \\) is mass, \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \\( h \\) is height.\n","\n","3. **Thermal Energy**: This form of energy is associated with the temperature of an object. It arises from the kinetic energy of atoms and molecules; the faster they move, the more thermal energy they possess.\n","\n","4. **Chemical Energy**: Found in the bonds of chemical compounds, this energy is released or absorbed during a chemical reaction. For instance, when fuels like coal or gasoline burn, they release energy that can be harnessed for work.\n","\n","5. **Nuclear Energy**: This energy is stored in the nucleus of atoms and can be released during nuclear fission or fusion. Nuclear power plants utilize fission reactions to generate electricity.\n","\n","### Conservation of Energy\n","\n","One of the most important principles regarding energy is the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This principle underpins many physical processes and is crucial for understanding energy flows in ecosystems, machines, and the universe at large.\n","\n","### Energy Sources\n","\n","Energy can be sourced from two main categories:\n","\n","1. **Renewable Energy**: These sources are replenished naturally and include solar power, wind energy, hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and biomass. They are considered more sustainable as they have a lower environmental impact and can mitigate climate change.\n","\n","2. **Non-Renewable Energy**: These sources, such\n","\n","Clear Output:\n"," Renewable energy sources are natural ways to generate power that won't run out. \n","\n","1. **Solar energy** harnesses sunlight using solar panels to produce electricity or heat. \n","\n","2. **Wind energy** captures the power of the wind with turbines that spin to generate electricity. \n","\n","3. **Hydropower** uses flowing water, usually from rivers or dams, to turn turbines and create energy. \n","\n","These sources are clean and sustainable, meaning they help reduce pollution and combat climate change, making them essential for a greener future!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Principle 2 ‚Äî Specify Format**\n","\n","**Goal:** Tell the AI exactly how to structure its response."],"metadata":{"id":"5iqa31WSqcBA"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["para_prompt = \"Compare Phone A, Phone B, and Phone C.\"\n","table_prompt = \"Compare Phone A, Phone B, and Phone C in a markdown table with columns: Phone, Display, Camera, Battery.\"\n","\n","print(\"Paragraph Output:\\n\", ask_gpt(para_prompt))\n","print(\"\\nTable Output:\\n\", ask_gpt(table_prompt))"],"metadata":{"id":"Pg1mp1Wgql5v","outputId":"84f5e106-4aa9-43a8-b748-17500c11d238","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754918845636,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":9789,"user":{"displayName":"Rania","userId":"13750069140470329881"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Paragraph Output:\n"," To provide a comparison of Phone A, Phone B, and Phone C, I would need specific details about each phone, such as:\n","\n","1. **Brand and Model**: What are the specific models of the phones?\n","2. **Specifications**: Key specs like processor, RAM, storage options, camera quality, battery capacity, display type and size, etc.\n","3. **Operating System**: What OS do they run (e.g., Android, iOS)?\n","4. **Features**: Special features such as 5G support, waterproofing, unique camera capabilities, etc.\n","5. **Price**: What is the price range for each phone?\n","6. **Target Audience**: Are they aimed at budget, mid-range, or flagship consumers?\n","7. **User Reviews**: Any notable feedback or ratings from users?\n","\n","With this information, I can provide a detailed comparison.
