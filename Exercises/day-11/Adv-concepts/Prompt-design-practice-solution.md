> **Note:** Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your real OpenAI API Key before running in Colab.

```python
# ==== Setup ====
!pip install openai -q

from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

def ask_gpt(prompt, temperature=0.7, max_tokens=500):
    """Send prompt to GPT-4o-mini and return model's reply text."""

## üìå **How to Use in Colab**

1. Copy all the above cells into a Colab notebook.
2. Run the **Setup** cell first (install + API key).
3. Run each section to see an example of the advanced technique.
4. Compare variations in prompt style and note differences in:
    - Structure
    - Depth of reasoning
    - Context handling between turns
