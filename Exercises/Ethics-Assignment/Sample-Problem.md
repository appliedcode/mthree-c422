## Team Case Study Assignment: AI Credit Scoring and Socioeconomic Equity

### Overview

Your team acts as an AI Ethics advisory group tasked with analyzing the fairness and ethical implications of AI credit scoring models, using the provided real-time case study on fairness evaluation with the BRIO tool. You will critically assess the fairness issues uncovered in credit scoring algorithms, understand the socioeconomic impacts, and develop actionable recommendations to mitigate bias and promote equity in AI-driven lending.

The final deliverable is a **group presentation** that clearly communicates your analysis, findings, and proposed ethical solutions.

### Assignment Instructions

- Form teams of 3 to 5 members.
- Thoroughly review the linked case study documents:
    - [AI Fairness Evaluation on Credit Scoring Models Using BRIO Tool (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.03292v1)
    - [Harnessing AI for Environmental Justice Report (Friends of the Earth UK)](https://policy.friendsoftheearth.uk/reports/harnessing-ai-environmental-justice)
- Analyze the key fairness challenges identified in AI credit scoring systems, especially pertaining to socioeconomic and demographic disparities.
- Investigate how bias in data and algorithms leads to discriminatory lending practices and social inequities.
- Discuss the implications for individuals and communities affected by unfair credit decisions.
- Propose technical, policy, and governance strategies to detect, mitigate, and monitor bias in credit scoring AI.
- Highlight the role of transparency, explainability, stakeholder engagement, and regulatory compliance in achieving equitable AI outcomes.
