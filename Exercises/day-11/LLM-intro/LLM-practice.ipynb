        "\n",
        "- Write a prompt asking an AI to explain how photosynthesis works.\n",
        "- Try two versions:\n",
        "a) Give a brief explanation in 3 sentences.\n",
        "b) Give a detailed explanation with examples, formatted in bullet points.\n",
        "- Compare the length, clarity, and completeness of the outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "***\n",
        "\n",
        "### Exercise 2: Few-Shot Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "- Create a few-shot prompt that shows how to politely decline an invitation in English and French.\n",
        "- Provide 2 examples (English phrase + French translation).\n",
        "- Add a new English phrase and ask the model to provide the French translation.\n",
        "- Experiment by changing the number of examples and observe changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "***\n",
        "\n",
        "### Exercise 3: Persona Roleplay\n",
        "\n",
        "- Write a prompt instructing the model to behave as a friendly travel guide for Tokyo.\n",
        "- Ask for recommendations on places to visit and food to try.\n",
        "- Rewrite the prompt to roleplay as a strict tour manager focusing on timing and schedules.\n",

        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "ACTION = Translate, Summarize, Explain  \n",
        "FORMAT = Plain, Bullets, Numbered  \n",

        "\n",
        "### Exercise 7: Controlling Output Length and Style\n",
        "\n",
        "- Ask the model to describe ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence‚Äù in:\n",
        "a) a tweet (280 characters max)\n",
        "b) a formal academic abstract (~150 words)\n",
        "c) a children‚Äôs story (simple language)\n",
        "- Observe how the style and complexity change with length constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "***\n",
        "\n",
        "### Exercise 8: Multi-turn Conversation Simulation\n",
        "\n",
        "- Simulate a customer support dialogue where the AI asks clarifying questions before providing a solution to a printer issue.\n",
        "- Write prompt instructions to make the AI confirm your answers before continuing.\n",
        "- Try chaining multiple prompts and see how memory of conversation context influences coherence.\n",

            "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems, encompassing a range of functionalities such as learning, reasoning, and self-correction. This interdisciplinary field integrates concepts from computer science, cognitive psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience to create algorithms and models that can interpret data, recognize patterns, and make decisions autonomously. AI is categorized into various subfields, including machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision, each contributing to the enhancement of system capabilities. As AI systems evolve, they demonstrate significant potential across diverse domains, from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment, thereby reshaping industries and societal structures. However, the rapid advancement of AI also raises ethical, security, and regulatory concerns, necessitating ongoing discourse about its implications on employment, privacy, and human agency. This abstract underscores the dual nature of AI as both a transformative technological force and a catalyst for critical societal challenges.\n"
