        "\n",
        "In this exercise, you will build an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipeline in Google Colab using the publicly available \"Global Superstore\" dataset, which contains sales transactions, customer, and product data from a fictional worldwide retail store.\n",

        "### 1. Extract\n",
        "- **Download:**  \n",
        "  Download the Global Superstore dataset CSV from this public URL:  \n",
        "  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/supermarket_Sales.csv  \n",
        "- **Load:**  \n",
        "  Load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame:  \n",
        "  ```python\n",

        "- **Clean:**  \n",
        "- Handle missing or inconsistent data entries.  \n",
        "- Rename columns for clarity if needed.  \n",
        "- Convert date columns (e.g., `Invoice Date`) to datetime format.  \n",
        "- **Feature Engineering:**  \n",
        "- Calculate `OrderProcessingTime` as the difference (in days) between `Ship Date` and `Order Date` (if present), or between `Invoice Date` and `Order Date`.  \n",
        "- Categorize sales into \"Low\", \"Medium\", and \"High\" based on quantiles of the `Total` column.  \n",
        "- Extract the year and month from the invoice date for time series analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Load\n",
        "- **SQLite Storage:**  \n",
        "Store the transformed DataFrame inside a local SQLite database within Colab.  \n",
        "- **SQL Queries:**  \n",
        "- Retrieve total sales by `City` and `Category`.  \n",
        "- Find the average order processing time by `Customer Type`.  \n",

        "\n",
        "- All ETL steps must be performed using pandas, SQLite, and Python standard libraries within Colab only.  \n",
