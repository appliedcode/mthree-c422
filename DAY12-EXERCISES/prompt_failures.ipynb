Chlorophyll primarily absorbs light in the blue (around 430-450 nm) and red (around 640-680 nm) wavelengths, while reflecting green light (around 500-550 nm), which is why plants appear green.\n",

Special relativity revolutionized our understanding of space and time, asserting that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers and introducing the famous equation E=mc², which shows the equivalence of mass and energy; it also explains phenomena such as time dilation and length contraction, exemplified by particles moving close to the speed of light appearing to experience less time than stationary observers. General relativity expanded this framework to include gravity, proposing that mass curves spacetime, which explains why planets orbit stars; a classic example is the prediction of light bending around massive objects, confirmed during a solar eclipse in 1919. Historically, these theories challenged Newtonian physics and laid the groundwork for modern cosmology and astrophysics, significantly influencing fields such as GPS technology, where time dilation effects must be accounted for. Common misconceptions include the belief that relativity only applies at very high speeds or that it suggests time travel is possible in a practical sense, when in reality, the effects of relativity become significant only at speeds approaching that of light. Overall, Einstein's relativity fundamentally altered our comprehension of the universe, reshaping the relationship between space, time, and gravity. \n",

            "Sure! The theory of special relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905, is a fundamental theory in physics that describes how space and time are interconnected and how they behave at high speeds, particularly those close to the speed of light. Here are the key points explained in simple terms:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Speed of Light is Constant**: One of the main ideas is that the speed of light in a vacuum (about 299,792 kilometers per second or 186,282 miles per second) is always the same, no matter how fast you're moving or in which direction. This is different from everyday experiences where speeds can combine, like a car moving faster if you drive toward another moving car.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Time Dilation**: Time can pass at different rates depending on how fast you're moving. If you travel very close to the speed of light, time will slow down for you compared to someone who is stationary. This means if you went on a space journey at near-light speed and then returned, you might find that less time has passed for you than for people on Earth.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Length Contraction**: Objects moving at very high speeds will appear shorter in the direction of motion to a stationary observer. So, if a spaceship travels really fast, an observer on the ground would see it as being shorter than it actually is.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Mass and Energy**: Special relativity also tells us that mass and energy are related. The famous equation \\(E = mc^2\\) means that energy (E) and mass (m) are interchangeable; they are different forms of the same thing. This implies that as an object moves faster and approaches the speed of light, its mass effectively increases, requiring more energy to continue accelerating it.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Simultaneity is Relative**: Events that appear to happen at the same time from one observer's point of view may not seem simultaneous to another observer moving at a different speed. This challenges our intuitive understanding of time.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, special relativity changes how we think about space and time, showing that they are not absolute but relative to the observer's speed. It has profound implications for physics, affecting everything from GPS systems to our understanding of the universe. \n",

            "--- Smaller Prompt 2 ---\n",
            "The theory of general relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915, is a fundamental theory of gravitation that describes gravity not as a force, but as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. According to this theory, massive objects like planets, stars, and galaxies warp the fabric of spacetime around them, and this curvature affects the motion of other objects.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Basic Concepts of General Relativity\n",
            "1. **Spacetime**: General relativity combines the three dimensions of space with the dimension of time into a four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.\n",
            "2. **Curvature**: Massive objects cause spacetime to curve, and this curvature influences the paths that objects travel. Instead of moving in straight lines, objects move along paths called geodesics, which are the shortest paths in curved spacetime.\n",
            "3. **Equivalence Principle**: This principle states that the effects of gravity are indistinguishable from acceleration. For example, being in a closed box on Earth feels the same as being in a box accelerating through space.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Real-World Example: The Orbit of Mercury\n",
            "One of the classic tests of general relativity is its explanation of the orbit of Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun. Mercury's orbit precesses, meaning that the point of closest approach to the Sun (the perihelion) shifts over time. \n",
            "\n",
            "#### Classical Newtonian Prediction\n",
            "Using Newton's law of gravitation, astronomers could predict Mercury's orbit fairly well, but there was a discrepancy. The orbit was observed to precess more than Newtonian mechanics could account for—by about 574 arcseconds per century.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Einstein's Contribution\n",
            "When Einstein applied his theory of general relativity to Mercury's orbit, he found that the curvature of spacetime caused by the Sun's mass could explain the additional precession of Mercury's orbit. The Sun's gravitational field warps the spacetime around it, altering the path that Mercury follows. \n",
            "\n",
            "### Results\n",
            "When calculations were made using general relativity, they correctly accounted for the observed precession of Mercury's orbit. The prediction matched observations precisely, providing strong evidence for the validity of general relativity.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Conclusion\n",
            "General relativity has profound implications beyond Mercury’s orbit, influencing our understanding of black holes, gravitational waves, and the expansion of the universe. It fundamentally changed our view of gravity from a force acting at a distance to a geometric property of spacetime itself. This theory not only offers a framework for understanding celestial mechanics but also has practical applications like GPS technology, which must account for the effects of general relativity to provide accurate location data. \n",

            "Relativity, particularly Einstein's theories of special and general relativity, has led to various misconceptions. Here are some common ones:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Relativity is Just About Speed**: While special relativity does address the effects of high speeds, it encompasses more, including time dilation and the interrelationship between space and time.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Time Travel is Possible**: While general relativity allows for theoretical constructs (like wormholes) that might permit time travel, such scenarios are speculative and not practically achievable with current technology.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Time Dilation Means Time Actually Slows Down**: Time dilation refers to the way time is measured differently for observers in different frames of reference. It doesn’t mean time itself slows down; rather, clocks run at different rates depending on their relative velocities or gravitational fields.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Mass Increases with Speed**: A common misconception is that an object's mass increases as it approaches the speed of light. In relativity, it’s more accurate to say that relativistic effects change the object's momentum and energy, but the rest mass remains constant.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Nothing Can Move Faster Than Light**: While it's true that, according to relativity, no information or matter can exceed the speed of light in a vacuum, some interpretations of quantum mechanics (like quantum entanglement) suggest phenomena that can appear to occur faster than light without transmitting information.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Gravity is a Force Like Other Forces**: In general relativity, gravity is not a conventional force but rather the curvature of spacetime caused by mass. Objects follow paths in this curved spacetime, which we perceive as gravitational attraction.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Relativity is Only Relevant for High Speeds or Massive Objects**: While the effects of relativity become significant at high speeds or in strong gravitational fields, they are also applicable in everyday situations, such as GPS satellites needing to account for relativistic effects to provide accurate positioning.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Einstein Said Everything is Relative**: While relativity introduces the idea that measurements can vary based on the observer's frame of reference, it does not mean \"everything is relative.\" There are absolute laws of physics that hold true across all frames.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **The Twin Paradox is a Paradox**: The twin paradox, where one twin ages more slowly than the other due to traveling at high speed, is not a real paradox. It can be resolved by recognizing that the traveling twin experiences acceleration and deceleration, breaking the symmetry of the situation.\n",
            "\n",
            "10. **Black Holes are Just Theoretical**: While black holes were once considered theoretical, they have been observed indirectly through their effects on nearby matter and directly imaged via the Event Horizon Telescope.\n",

Efficient sorting algorithms typically have a time complexity of O(n log n) for average and worst-case scenarios. Examples of such algorithms include Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
